/**
 * The iOS long-press overlay. Layout measured from `references/ios/captures/longpress-*.png`:
 * the pressed bubble is lifted about its trailing edge by a uniform scale that widens it by 26.07,
 * capped at 1.15. Three pressed bubbles fix that, each measured against its own unpressed copy in
 * `conv3-light.png`: "Ok" 49.62×40.08 → 57.15×45.96 hits the cap, while the wider two-liners take the
 * same 26: "Every detail…" 250.96×60.24 → 277.00×66.43 (1.1037 wide, 1.1027 tall) and "Aaaa…"
 * 280.63×60.24 → 306.74×65.82 (1.0930 / 1.0926). A height-driven rule would miss "Aaaa…" by 2 pt.
 * Each grows about its own centre, which rises 0.18 (0.135 for "Ok", 0.222 for "Aaaa…", and the "Ok"
 * glyph ink agrees at 0.17). The text rides the scale: that glyph ink also grows 1.148 × 1.132, so
 * `textScale` stays 1. The tapback pill sits 5 above the bubble (measured 5.09) and stretches from
 * the screen margin (10.83) to the bubble's trailing edge, the
 * emoji-picker bubble hangs from the pill with its centre 28 beside the bubble, and the 250-wide menu
 * starts 16.1 below the bubble's own bottom edge, tail included (the 6.8 hang scales with the lift).
 * Six frames give 16.07/16.11/16.07/16.09/16.11/16.2, reading each menu's top off its first row's
 * "Copy" ink rather than its washed-out glass edge. If the menu would pass 42 above the frame's
 * bottom (three frames clamp there, all with their menu top at 644.02) or the bar rise above 60, the
 * whole group shifts; incoming bubbles mirror everything (bar 16→391.17, picker to the right, menu
 * left-aligned). `topInset` is the one number here with no capture behind it: nothing in the nine
 * long-press frames pushes the bar high enough to clamp.
 *
 * Motion (60 fps frames in references/ios/motion/): dim from 0 ms; bubble lift + menu unfolding from
 * the bubble's corner over ≈130 ms; the pill expands from the picker circle over ≈200 ms; glyphs fade
 * in left to right with a 17 ms stagger. `progress` (0..1) scrubs the whole timeline.

/**
 * The dim behind the overlay. It covers the whole screen: the status bar and the nav bar go under it
 * with the list, unblurred and not re-drawn above it. Fitted, not guessed — `longpress-ok-light.png`
 * is `conv3-light.png` with one message pressed, so one capture over the other measures the dim
 * directly. Outside the overlay's own furniture (device rows 1356-2349) and the status-bar clock (the
 * two captures are 24 minutes apart) every pixel of that frame is `capture = screen·0.79 +
 * (22,21,42)·0.21`, residual 0.14/255 mean and 0.9 max over the nav bar's full 0-255 range. Three more
 * pairs agree: `incoming-light.png` -> `longpress-incoming-light.png` and `conv2-dark.png` ->
 * `longpress-last-bubble-dark.png` come back at 0.001/255 mean error — exact after rounding — and the
 * same value carries `longpress-two-line-light.png`. It is one dim in both themes, and one alpha over
 * every layer: fitting the bands of the light pair separately gives 0.2103/0.2092/0.2130 over the nav
 * bar, 0.2105/0.2054/0.2129 over the list and 0.2133/0.2118/0.2172 over the composer.
 *
 * The (22,18,44) this used to carry renders white as (206,205,210) where every light capture reads
 * #ceced2 = (206,206,210): the green channel was a level dark everywhere the dim fell.
 *
 * Chrome cannot land both ends of this at once, and the last level is its rounding, not the value.
 * It composites an overlay as `round(src·(1-a₈)) + round(tint·a₈)` with the alpha quantised to
 * 54/255, so the tint's contribution is one rounded triple: over black it is (5,4,9), which fixes
 * white at 201+(5,4,9) = (206,205,210). Native rounds the sum instead and gets (5,4,9) over black and
 * (206,206,210) over white from the same value. (23,22,43) buys the light end (measured over the lab's
 * nav band: interior G +0.2 instead of -0.8) and loses the dark one by the same level (+1.0 instead of
 * 0.0), so this keeps the measured number and wears one level of green over bright grounds.
 *
 * `--im-dim` still wins wherever a palette sets it, and `tapback.tsx` sets it for both themes; it now
 * carries this same value. Two fallbacks elsewhere are still the old one and want correcting:
 * `message-reply.tsx` (the reply-thread dim) and `tapback-details.tsx` (the details scrim).
 *
 * KNOWN WRONG, and not fixable from here: this dim reaches the Dynamic Island, and nothing may. The
 * island is a hardware cutout the OS composites above the app, so it reads #000000 in every capture
 * that has an overlay over it — `longpress-*`, `newmsg-light.png`, `plus-menu-open-light.png`,
 * `details-light.png`, `photo-picker-light.png` — while the status bar around it dims with everything
 * else (#ceced2 under this dim, #cccccc under the sheet's). Under our dim it goes to (5,4,9), a flat
 * +6 over the island's 125.33×36.67 pt, which is 6.4% of the 0 0 402 168 band. The fix belongs where
 * the island is drawn (`ios-status-bar.tsx` plus the app's z-order), not in one overlay: every dim in
 * the app has the same bug.
