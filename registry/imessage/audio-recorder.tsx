/**
 * Recording a voice message: the composer's field becomes a row carrying a live waveform, a running
 * timer and a stop button; stopping swaps the stop for a play control, a duration pill with a `+`,
 * and a send pill.
 *
 * ## Where these numbers come from
 *
 * **No capture in `references/` holds this screen on either platform**, so every geometric number
 * below was read out of ChatKit — the framework both Messages apps run on — by a Mac Catalyst probe
 * whose full source is committed in `references/audio-recorder.md` and whose readings are tabulated
 * in `references/SPEC.md` ("Audio recorder"). The probe dlopens
 * `/System/iOSSupport/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ChatKit.framework/ChatKit`, swizzles
 * `-[UIDevice userInterfaceIdiom]` so `+[CKUIBehavior sharedBehaviors]` vends the Phone or the Mac
 * behaviour, stubs `+[IMService iMessageService]` (which the view's initialiser force-unwraps), then
 * **builds the real view**: `-[CKAudioMessageRecordingView initWithFrame:service:]`, feeds it known
 * intensities through `-addToWaveformWithIntensity:`, walks `-setState:` 0 to 3 and reads every
 * subview's frame, colour, radius, font and symbol image back. The frames below are the frames
 * Messages lays out.
 *
 * ChatKit's `-setState:` has four states; three of them are this component's:
 * 1 `recording`, 2 `stopped`, 3 `playing` (0 is the empty pose before recording starts).
 *
 * ### The row
 *
 * `-[CKAudioMessageRecordingView sizeThatFits:]` returns **52** tall on Phone and **49** on Mac.
 * Every child is centred in it, and — this reproduces all twelve measured child frames exactly —
 * **each child's leading or trailing inset equals its own vertical inset**, `(rowHeight - size) / 2`:
 * the 34/31 circles sit 9 in, the 30 x 22 send pill 15 in on Phone and 13.5 on Mac. Every gap
 * between neighbours is `audioRecordingViewDurationSpacing` **12**, except the waveform's leading
 * inset while recording, which is `audioRecordingViewButtonSpacing` **16** (there is no play button
 * to sit beside). Those two rules close on 294 and on 530 in all three states:
 *
 * | | leading | waveform | trailing chain |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | iOS recording | 16 | 181.5 | 12 + timer 29.5 + 12 + stop 34 + 9 |
 * | iOS stopped | 9 + play 34 + 12 | 109 | 12 + append 61 + 12 + send 30 + 15 |
 * | iOS playing | 9 + play 34 + 12 | 140.5 | 12 + timer 29.5 + 12 + send 30 + 15 |
 * | macOS recording | 16 | 415 | 12 + timer 35 + 12 + stop 31 + 9 |
 * | macOS stopped | 9 + play 31 + 12 | 348 | 12 + append 62.5 + 12 + send 30 + 13.5 |
 * | macOS playing | 9 + play 31 + 12 | 375.5 | 12 + timer 35 + 12 + send 30 + 13.5 |
 *
 * The waveform view is **0.75 of the row** — 39 in the 52 (which is `audioWaveformViewHeight`) and
 * 36.75 in the 49 — and is vertically centred, top 6.5 / 6.125.
 *
 * ### The waveform
 *
 * Bars are `waveformPowerLevelWidth` **2** wide with a radius of 1, `audioWaveformGapWidth` **2**
 * apart, so the pitch is 4; they are vertically centred and the strip is anchored to the box's
 * trailing edge, which leaves `width - 2 - (count - 1) * 4` empty at the leading edge (3 of hole in
 * a 109 box: measured, not a bug).
 *
 * **`height = level² × waveformViewHeight`, floored at `minimumWaveformHeight` 4.** Feeding the view
 * a ramp and reading the segments back: 0.3333 → 4.3333, 0.4 → 6.24, 0.4444 → 7.7037, 0.5 → 9.75,
 * 0.6 → 14.04, 0.6667 → 17.3334, 0.75 → 21.9375, 0.8 → 24.96, 0.9 → 31.59, 1 → 39 — every one of
 * them exactly `level² × 39`, and everything below 0.3203 clamped to 4. It scales to the **view**
 * height 39, not to `audioWaveformHeight` 35; a full-scale bar fills the box edge to edge.
 *
 * While recording, the newest bars ramp in: a bar `k` segments back from the leading edge is scaled
 * by **`min(1, sqrt(k / 4))`**, measured to five decimals at k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (0, 0.5, 0.70711,
 * 0.86603, 1), with the k = 0 bar additionally at opacity 0. Bars ahead of the take are drawn at the
 * minimum height and half opacity, which is the track the wave is written onto.
 *
 * Once stopped, the take is resampled up to the bars that fit by **nearest neighbour**, bar `j`
 * taking level `floor(j × n / count)` — 5 levels in a 27-bar box measured as runs of 6, 5, 6, 5, 5.
 * The played part is **`max(1, floor(fraction × count))`** bars, checked at nine positions.
 *
 * ### Colours, resolved with `-resolvedColorWithTraitCollection:` in both styles
 *
 * - recording bars and timer ink `#FF383C` light / `#FF4245` dark, at full opacity, over a track of
 *   the same colour at 0.5;
 * - stopped and playing bars `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.498)` / `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.549)`, the part not yet
 *   played at 0.5 of that;
 * - play button fill `rgba(118, 118, 128, 0.12)` light and **0.24 dark** (the framework's own
 *   `UIBackgroundConfiguration`, read per trait), glyph `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.847)` / `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.847)`;
 * - stop button fill `rgba(255, 56, 60, 0.19)` in **both** styles, glyph the red above;
 * - the stopped duration pill `rgba(116, 116, 128, 0.08)` in both styles with 84.7% label ink; while
 *   recording and while playing the same pill has **no fill at all**;
 * - send `#0088ff` with a white arrow;
 * - the cancel button's `xmark` at 84.7% label ink over glass.
 *
 * ### Glyphs
 *
 * Each is the framework's own symbol image, rasterised at 8x and measured for its ink box and its
 * coverage, and the outlines below are fitted to both:
 *
 * | control | symbol | ink | coverage |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | stop | `stop.fill` 17 regular | 14 x 14 | 180.3853 |
 * | play | `play.fill` 17 regular | 12.5 x 14 | 101.8686 |
 * | pause | `pause.fill` 17 regular | 10.5 x 14 | 110.7490 |
 * | append | `plus` 17 regular | 14 x 14 | 37.4529 |
 * | send | `arrow.up` 17 **bold** | 13.5 x 16 | 68.9608 |
 * | cancel | `xmark` **16 medium** | 13 x 13 | 55.3471 |
 *
 * The send arrow's stem measures **2.4098** of stroke, which is the same weight `conv3-light.png`
 * gives the composer's own send pill (2.41 measured there) — but it is not the same drawing: the
 * composer's is a 38 x 28 pill and this is a 30 x 22 one, so the arrow is smaller here.
 *
 * The `xmark` is the one place the two fits disagree: its rows integrate to 4.9588 of ink, i.e.
 * 1.7532 of stroke at 45 degrees, while its total coverage wants 1.68. The 1.68 is drawn, because
 * total coverage is the more robust measure and is what this repo fits elsewhere.
 *
 * ## What is *not* from the framework
 *
 * - **Where the surface sits in the composer.** ChatKit's own
 *   `entryViewLeftInsetForRecordedAudioCancelButton` is 8.5 on both idioms, which is neither the
 *   iOS composer's measured 28 nor the macOS `+`'s measured 9, so its frame of reference could not
 *   be established and it is not used. Instead the cancel circle is centred on the **measured**
 *   centre of the `+` it replaces (iOS x 48, `SPEC.md`; macOS pane x 24) and the row takes the
 *   **measured** field box (iOS x 80–374, macOS pane x 49–579). Both rest their bottom edge on the
 *   composer's measured baseline (iOS y 846, macOS pane y 629), because every other element of both
 *   composers is bottom-aligned there. The row is taller than the field it replaces, so it grows
 *   upward. Derived from measurements, but not itself measured.
 * - **The row's corner radius.** UNMEASURED: `-[CKAudioMessageRecordingView cornerRadius]` is 0
 *   until the entry view sets it, and nothing in the framework stores what it sets. Drawn as a
 *   capsule (half the row's height), because both composer fields are capsules at one line.
 * - **The row's fill, rim and shadow.** Copied from the two composer files, which measured them, so
 *   that this stays a registry item with no dependency on either.
 * - **The entrance and the exit.** UNMEASURED. 260 / 200 ms on the iOS effects screen's measured
 *   `cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1)`; a reuse, not a measurement of this surface.
 * - **The spring's frequency.** `stateChangeAnimationDuration` 0.6 and `stateChangeSpringDamping`
 *   0.86 are the view's own Swift ivars, read at their offsets; the frequency UIKit derives from
 *   that pair is not stored anywhere, so `springEasing` samples the spring whose envelope has
 *   decayed to 0.1% at 0.6 s. A fit.
 * - **The slide between segments.** ChatKit lays every bar on a 4 pt grid, so its model steps 4 pt
 *   twelve times a second; whether its display link interpolates between those frames cannot be read
 *   from a view that never runs. This slides the strip by `4 × frac(t / segment)`, which is the
 *   smallest continuous interpolation of the measured layout and is exactly ChatKit's frame at every
 *   whole segment.
 *
 * Every animation is seekable rather than merely playable: the slide is one Web Animations timeline
 * whose offset is linear in time, the state change takes `transition={{ from, progress }}` the way
 * `MacComposer` takes `grow`, and `progress` seeks the entrance and the exit to a frame rather than
 * jumping them to the end. `prefers-reduced-motion` builds no timeline at all and poses the row.
