 * 1. A control inside the row takes its own click: the reply count, the stub's jump button, a link

 * 2. A press that reaches the 500 ms hold, a right click, or a double click belongs to the message
 *    actions (the shells bind those on the log itself), so the click that ends one opens no thread.
 *    A press that travelled more than 8 px is a scroll or a text drag, not a tap.
 * 3. What is left is a plain tap, and on a message that has replies it opens the thread, the way
 *    native does. Except in click-to-select mode: there a click selects the message (macOS,
 *    measured), and the reply count stays the way in.
 * 4. Keyboard: the log's arrow keys focus a row, and Enter or Space on it opens its thread. When the
