/**
 * iOS 26 **group** conversation details, the screen a group's name pill opens.
 *
 * No capture in `references/` shows a group, so this screen is built from three sources and the
 * comment on every number says which one it is.
 *
 * **A. Measured on `references/ios/captures/details-light.png` / `details-dark.png`** (402×874 @3x),
 * through `ios-details.tsx`, which SPEC's fidelity table records at 0.08% against those frames. The
 * two screens share their whole frame, so these are used unchanged:
 *
 * - Back button Ø44 glass circle at (16, 62); the header photo slot Ø80 at (161, 62), centre (201, 102).
 * - Name 28px/33px bold (Chrome's fit to the measured 26pt ink box y 152.33–177.67), box top 146.15.
 * - Round glass action circles Ø54 with their centres on y 222.667, on a measured 74 pt pitch: three
 *   of them measure x 127 / 201 / 275. Centring an even count about x 201 is a **derivation** from
 *   that pitch, not a reading — see `actionLeft`.
 * - Grouped cells span x 16–386 (370 wide), radius 26 continuous, 20 between groups, first cell top
 *   269.6667. Row text starts 16 inside the cell (x 32); a plain text row is 52 tall; the separator
 *   is a 1 pt hairline on the row boundary, carried the way `ios-details.tsx` carries it.
 * - Cell and button fills: 6% black light / 12% white dark. Blue #0088ff / #0091ff, red #ff383c /
 *   #ff4245, separator #dadadb / #3a3a3c, secondary label #848488 / #98989f, chevron #bdbdbd / #5d5d5d.
 * - The screen sits over the conversation, blurred σ18 under a 49% white / 59% black scrim.
 * - `iosDetailsMotion`, `iosDetailsMorph`, `iosDetailsCollapse`, `IosSwitch` and `subpixel` are
 *   imported from that file rather than restated, so the two screens cannot drift apart.
 *
 * **B. Rendered by ChatKit 26 and measured off that render.** A probe app (`clang -target
 * arm64-apple-ios18.0-simulator`, `dlopen` of `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ChatKit.framework`
 * inside the booted iPhone 17 Pro simulator — the same 402×874 @3x geometry as the captures) builds
 * the real cells, lays them out at the measured 370 cell width, dumps every frame, and is
 * screenshotted so the ink can be measured with `scripts/measure/px.py`. What it returned:
 *
 * | Value | Where it comes from |
 * |---|---|
 * | The header photo is the **Snowglobe** stack, not the pancake | A `CKAvatarView` given three contacts and a Ø80 frame draws faces at x 9.667–47.667 / y 32.333–61.333 / x 22.667–46.333, which is `group-avatar.tsx`'s `snowglobeSlots(3)` scaled to 80 to within a third of a point. `CKDetailsAvatarPancakeView` — the lozenge this file used to draw — is a *different* view: `CKDetailsGroupHeaderCell._avatarView`, 41 tall, with `configureCellIconForCollapsedState:`. The details header's photo is `CKGroupPhotoCell._groupView`. |
 * | Group photo ground disc | The Ø80 `CKAvatarView` paints a full-diameter disc behind the faces: measured #f4f5f5 over white and #1f1f20 over black. Light is exactly `+[UIColor quaternarySystemFillColor]` rgba(116,116,128,0.08); the dark alpha is fitted to the measured composite (quaternary's own 0.18 lands 10/255 too dark). |
 * | Participant row 64 tall, avatar Ø37, 12 to the name | `+[CKDetailsContactsStandardTableViewCell preferredHeight]` = 64 and the rendered cell: avatar Ø37 at x 8 y 13.333, name label at x 57 = 8 + 37 + 12. |
 * | Participant name 17 **semibold**, full label colour | The rendered `CKDetailsContactsTableViewCell.nameLabel` is `.SFUI-Semibold 17.0` at rgba(0,0,0,1) — so `detailsContactCellTitleColor`'s 84.71% is not what the cell paints. |
 * | Participant separator inset = the name column | The rendered cell's own hairline starts at x 57, the name column, and runs to the cell's trailing edge. Here that is 16 + 37 + 12 = **65**. |
 * | Add row 44 tall, button Ø37, glyph 13.667 square on a 1.444 stroke | `+[CKDetailsAddMemberStandardCell preferredHeight]` = 44; the rendered circle measures Ø37.000 at x 8 y 3.333 and its plus measures 13.6667 × 13.6667 pt of ink with a 4.33 device-px (1.4444 pt) stroke. |
 * | Add button fill | The rendered circle is #efeff0 over white and #323236 over the cell's own #1c1c1e in dark: both are exactly `-[CKUITheme detailsAddButtonBackgroundColor]` rgba(118,118,128,0.12 / 0.24). |
 * | "Add Contact" | `ADD_CONTACT` in ChatKit's en loctable, and the string the rendered cell actually shows. (`ADD_MEMBER` "Add Member" also exists and is exported for the callers that want it.) |
 * | Group count row 22 | `+[CKDetailsGroupCountCell preferredHeight]` = 22, `DETAILS_VIEW_GROUP_COUNT_TEXT` "%lu PEOPLE" / "%lu PERSON". |
 * | Show-all row 44 | `+[CKDetailsShowMoreContactsCell preferredHeight]` = 44 — native truncates a long member list. ChatKit has no string of its own for that row, so `SEARCH_SHOW_MORE` "See All" stands in. |
 * | Two action buttons, not three | `CKDetailsGroupNameCell` carries exactly `_phoneButton` and `_facetimeVideoButton`; there is no mail button on a group. |
 * | Copy | `ChatKit.loctable` (en), verbatim in `groupDetailsCopy`. |
 *
 * **C. UNMEASURED**, and marked as such where it is used:
 *
 * - Every duration: the presentation and the header collapse are `ios-details.tsx`'s, whose own
 *   header already records them as unmeasured.
 * - The shared-content cells (photos grid, links, attachments). They are the sibling screen's, built
 *   the same way and placed where the sibling places them — after Hide Alerts, above the destructive
 *   row — so with none of them present this screen reproduces the measured cell stack exactly.
 * - The 110 photo tile: `(370 − 2×16 − 2×4)/3`. The 4 gap and the radius 12 are measured
 *   (`photo-picker-light.png`, SPEC line 164); three-across inside the measured 16 inset is not.
 *   `-[CKUIBehaviorPhone searchPhotosInterItemSpacingDetailsView]` = 1.5 and
 *   `searchPhotosCellZKWAndDetailsCornerRadius` = 4 are named for a details photo grid and match
 *   neither number; nothing in this repo can say which surface they belong to.
 * - The group-count subtitle's position under the name (opt-in; with no `subtitle` the header is the
 *   measured one, untouched).
 * - Centring an even number of action circles about x 201.
