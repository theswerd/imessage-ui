 * Photos and videos sent in a conversation. A photo takes the bubble's shape, tail included, so the
 * same traced outline in `bubble-shape.ts` clips the image instead of filling it.
 *
 * NOT MEASURED against a native photo message: the corner radius and tail come from the measured text
 * bubble. The multi-photo layout is the stack ChatKit actually draws, with the framework's own
 * constants — see `photoStackLayout` for which parts of composing them are a reading.
 *
 * ## What a photo message offers, and what is here (audit, 2026-09-09)
 *
 * | part                    | native evidence                                              | here |
 * |-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------|
 * | single photo's box      | `thumbnailFillSizeForWidth:imageSize:`, swept                 | yes, MEASURED, within 0.38 pt (ChatKit rounds to the device grid; see `photoBox`) |
 * | multi-photo box         | `-[CKUIBehavior previewBalloonSizeThatFits:]`, read at both idioms | yes, MEASURED: see `photoStackBox`. 375 x 353 on Mac, 350.625 x 332.625 on iPhone |
 * | balloon max width       | `balloonMaxWidthForTranscriptWidth:…`, `balloonMaxWidthPercent` 0.85 iPhone / 0.65 Mac | rule recorded in `balloonMaxWidth`; the group uses the measured constant and now cannot exceed its container |
 * | loading                 | `DOWNLOADING` = "Downloading…"                                 | partial: tiles hold on the placeholder and the group is `aria-busy`, but there is NO progress indicator and no "Downloading…" copy. `photoSheetProgressIndicatorSize` {20, 20} is the picker sheet, not the balloon, so the balloon's spinner is UNMEASURED |
 * | failed / not downloaded | `TAP_TO_DOWNLOAD`, `CLICK_TO_DOWNLOAD`, `downloadButtonFont` 17 | yes: copy and type size MEASURED; `pending` offers it without a failed fetch. A *send* failure is a different thing and belongs to the shell (`FailedSendBadge`, ChatKit's `_clearFailureBadge`), not to this component |
 * | video duration badge    | none on a transcript balloon                                   | NO — and correctly so. `CKMovieBalloonView` is `CKImageBalloonView` plus an `AVPlayerLayer` and has no duration label at all (`playsInlineVideo` = 1). The only `_durationLabel` in ChatKit is on `CKPhotoSearchResultCell`, the search-results cell. Adding one to a bubble would be inventing a control native does not draw |
 * | Live Photo badge        | `CKImageBalloonView._irisBadgeView`, `livePhotoBadgeImage`      | yes, added here: symbol identity and ring geometry MEASURED off the framework's own `UIImage` (see `livePhotoBadge`); its position in the tile is judgement |
 * | spatial badge           | `CKImageBalloonView._monoskiBadgeView`                          | NO. Not built; no size read yet |
 * | overflow count past 4   | `PXMessagesStackAdditionalItemsView`, `_localizedTitleForAdditionalItemsCount:` | yes: the last card slot stops being a photo and becomes the count card, a blur under SF Bold 17 in systemBlue reading "+7 Items". The copy and the type are MEASURED; the blur has nothing behind it to measure against |
 * | tap target → viewer     | —                                                              | yes: every tile is a `<button>` and `onOpenImage` hands the viewer the tile's own `DOMRect` |
 *
 ## The grid was the wrong layout, and it is gone
 *
 * There is no photo-*grid* balloon in ChatKit. Two or more attachments on one message are a **stack**:
 * `CKGenericPhotoStackBalloonView` over a `PXMessagesStackView`, which pages left and right
 * (`pageLeftAnimated:` / `pageRightAnimated:`) and counts the rest on a
 * `PXMessagesStackAdditionalItemsView`. The `CKPhotoGrid*` names in the framework belong to the
 * full-screen grid the stack opens into, not to the transcript. The accessibility format this file
 * quotes, `messages.attachment.stack.view.format`, is that stack view's.
 *
 * The note that used to sit here said the stack could not be built because its frames live in
 * PhotoFoundation's solver and no capture exists to fit them against. Half of that was wrong: the
 * constants are readable — see `photoStackLayout` — and they are what this draws now. The half that
 * still stands is that no capture of a multi-photo message exists, so *composing* those constants is
 * a reading and is marked as one.
 *
 * The stack's **outer box**, though, is no longer a guess — see `photoStackBox`. `PFMessagesStackLayoutFrameSolver`
 * only ever hands out *normalized* geometry (`normalizedVerticalInsets`, `normalizedVerticalOffset`,
 * `normalizedSizeTransform`, `normalizedHorizontalOffsets`), and `-[PXMessagesStackItemsLayoutHelper
 * maxItemSizeForReferenceSize:]` is handed the reference size from outside, so the absolute box has to
 * come from the chat item — and it does.
 *
 * The single photo's box, on the other hand, is now read out of ChatKit rather than guessed: see
 * `photoBox` below. So are the accessible names: ChatKit's own accessibility bundle
 * (`/System/iOSSupport/System/Library/AccessibilityBundles/ChatKitFramework.axbundle`,
 * `Accessibility.loctable`) calls one attachment `photo.attachment` = "Photo", counts them with
 * `attachment.count` = "%d attachments" and positions each one with
 * `messages.attachment.stack.view.format` = "attachment %1$d of %2$d".
 *
 * A photo sent together with text is NOT one balloon with a caption under the photo. ChatKit splits a
 * message into parts (`-[CKMessagePartChatItem messagePartRange]`, `CKTextMessagePartChatItem` vs
 * `CKAttachmentMessagePartChatItem`), and each part is its own balloon chat item, so native draws the
 * photo balloon and the text balloon as two bubbles of one cluster. "Caption" exists nowhere in the
 * image balloon; in ChatKit it belongs to Business Chat rich cards
 * (`-[CKBalloonView didTapTruncatedCaptionForRichCard:]`). The message list therefore renders the two,
 * passing `tail` to whichever comes last; this component stays a photo group.

 * cropped, since the answer is a *fill* size (its sibling `unconstrainedAspectFillSizeForWidth:`
 * returns the unclamped fit).
 *
 * `-[CKUIBehaviorMac thumbnailFillSizeForWidth:imageSize:]` overrides it and applies no shape clamp at

 *
 * `maxHeight` is a PORTRAIT-ONLY ceiling on both, which the sweep is unambiguous about: 3:4, 9:16 and

 * ever hands a photo 900 pt, so the two rules agree everywhere it is used; `portraitOnly` records
 * which one is native rather than leaving the wrong one to bind if a caller ever passes a wide box.
 *
 * Native rounds each result to the device pixel grid (it answers 158.0 where 280.5 x 0.5625 is
 * 157.78); the fractions are kept here, which is why the lab's own probe reports our box within 0.38 pt

/**
 * **A photo balloon is narrower than a text bubble, and this is the width it actually gets.**
 *
 * `bubbleMetrics.ios.maxWidth` is 280.5, and that is right for text — it is `(402 - 72) x 0.85` from
 * `balloonMaxWidthForTranscriptWidth:` to the last digit. A photo does not get it. Captured off a real
 * iPhone 17 Pro running iOS 26, a sent photo balloon measures **252.667 pt** across (758 device pixels
 * at 3x) with its right edge on 386.000 — the same trailing margin every text bubble uses — and that
 * width does not move between a 4:3, a 1:1 and a 3:4 photo.
 *
 * Two independent readings agree, which is why this is a constant and not a guess:
 *
 * | photo | device drew | `thumbnailFillSizeForWidth:252.667` | with 280.5 |
 * | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 * | 4:3 landscape | 189.667 | 189.5 | 210.5 |
 * | 1:1 square | 252.667 | 253.0 | 280.5 |
 * | 3:4 portrait | **337.0** | **337.0** | 374.0 |
 *
 * The portrait row is the one that settles it: 337.0 exactly, and the 280.5 column cannot produce it.
 *
 * **Where 252.667 comes from is not established.** It is not `balloonMaxWidthForTranscriptWidth:` at
 * any sensible inset — swept at 402 over insets 0…90 in eighths and every flag combination, the only
 * inset that lands on it is 52.375, which is not a number anything else in ChatKit uses. So this is a
 * measured constant for a 402 pt screen, exactly as `bubbleMetrics.ios.maxWidth` is, and a wider
 * transcript may well scale it. `macos` is `null` because no macOS capture holds a photo balloon; the
 * Mac keeps the bubble's own width until one does, rather than inheriting a number measured on a phone.
 *
 * **Re-measured on a second capture**, three 3:4 photos sent as a run, reading the lowest balloon
 * (the only one no chrome overlaps): 252.667 pt wide, right edge 386.000, and 343.667 pt tall — of
 * which 6.8 is the tail's hang, leaving a 336.9 pt body against the 337.0 the table above predicts.
 * Two captures, taken on different days from different photos, agree to a third of a point.
 *
 * The corner was measured at the same time and is **not** a separate constant. Fitting a circle to
 * the balloon's top-left arc gives 19.5–19.8 pt depending on where the edge threshold is put
 * (rmse 0.46–0.73 device px, so the arc really is circular), against `bubbleMetrics.ios.radius`
 * 20.0107 measured for a text bubble. The gap is smaller than the ±0.3 pt the threshold alone moves
 * it, so a photo balloon uses the bubble's corner and nothing here overrides it — a second constant
 * would be recording the measurement's noise, not the device's behaviour.

 * `+[CKBalloonChatItem resultingMaxWidthWithBalloonMaxWidth:fullMaxWidth:transcriptTraitCollection:
 * transcriptBackgroundLuminance:]` is a bare `ret`. So the whole rule is `previewBalloonSizeThatFits:`,
 * whose body is:
 *
 *     w' = min(w, previewMaxWidth) * 1.25
 *     h' = w' - 2 * (stackBalloonVerticalInset - smallTranscriptSpace)
 *
 * MEASURED twice: read out of the disassembly and then confirmed by calling the selector at both idioms
 * over a dozen widths (100…900), which reproduces the formula exactly. The three inputs, read at their
 * own idiom in their own process:
 *
 * | idiom  | previewMaxWidth | stackBalloonVerticalInset | smallTranscriptSpace | at its `maxWidth` |
 * |--------|-----------------|---------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
 * | iPhone | 761             | 15                        | 6                    | 280.5 → 350.625 x 332.625 |
 * | Mac    | **300**         | 15                        | 4                    | 382.5 → **375 x 353**     |
 *
 * `previewMaxWidth` is the whole story on the Mac: at 300 it saturates for any balloon max width at or
 * above 300, so a macOS photo group is **375 x 353 whatever the window does**, and 382.5 x 382.5 — the
 * text balloon's width squared by a 2x2 grid — was never a number ChatKit produces. It is also not
 * square: the height is 22 pt (Mac) / 18 pt (iPhone) short of the width.
 *
 * Nothing else bounds it, and several things that look like they might do not:
 *   - `calculatesWidthForAttachmentBalloons` is **0 on both idioms**, so it is not a Mac difference.
 *   - `attachmentBalloonSize` is `{187, 124.5}` on **both** idioms; it belongs to the fixed rich-icon
 *     file balloon (`attachmentBalloonRichIconInsets`), not to a photo.
 *   - `-[CKUIBehaviorMac thumbnailFillSizeForWidth:imageSize:]`, re-swept today at idiom 5 in its own
 *     process, still fills the width it is given with only the portrait 500 ceiling (see `photoBox`) —
 *     it never narrows anything, and it is the *single*-photo path, not this one.
 *   - `balloonMaxWidthPercent` 0.65 makes the Mac balloon proportionally narrower than the iPhone's, but
 *     it is the same balloon width a text bubble gets; there is no photo-specific percent.
 *   - `macTotalMarginWidth` = 40 is Mac-only and matches the measured `edgeInset` 20 per side, but
 *     `(630 - 40) x 0.65` = 383.5 against the capture's 382.5, so it still does not close that 1.0 pt.
 *   - There is no photo-grid or collage constant on either idiom.

/**
 * **The stack, with its numbers — and now with its frames.**
 *
 * ## Read this first: iOS 26's own send path never makes one of these
 *
 * Driving the real Messages app on an iPhone 17 Pro through XCUITest — attach N photos in the picker,
 * tap Send **once** — produces **N separate messages**, each a single-photo balloon, at N = 1, 3 and
 * 10. The ten-photo send put exactly ten cells in the transcript, each labelled "Your iMessage,
 * Includes picture", in the picked order. There is no fan, nothing behind the front card, and no
 * "+N Items" pill anywhere in the pixels or in any accessibility dump. `photo-run` in
 * `harness/scenarios.ts` is that, and it is what a user actually sees.
 *
 * So the geometry below is real — it came out of `PXMessagesStackView`'s own layout, and every frame
 * in the table is the framework's answer — but **the balloon it describes has not been observed on a
 * device**. `CKGenericPhotoStackBalloonView` exists and is fully built; what makes it appear is not
 * established. The obvious candidate, a *received* message carrying several attachments, could not be
 * produced: the simulator has no iMessage service and no `sms.db` to inject one into. Until something
 * does produce one, treat this as the drawing of a balloon the kit can render rather than as a
 * description of what sending photos looks like.
 *
 * The note this replaces said the solver could not be run, so the arithmetic below was a *reading* of
 * the normalized ivars. It can be run, and the reading was wrong in most of its parts. What works:
 * `-[CKGenericPhotoStackBalloonView _createStackView]` builds a plain `PXMessagesStackView` (not the
 * `CKMessagesCarouselView` that `+genericStackView` hands back); install it in a real balloon,
 * `layoutIfNeeded`, then drive the layout with `-[PXGItemsLayout setNumberOfItems:]` + `-update` and
 * no data source at all. `-[PXGLayout geometryForSpriteAtIndex:]` then returns a real frame and
 * `-styleForSpriteAtIndex:` a float vector whose `f[0]` is alpha, `f[14]` rotation in radians and
 * `f[15]` scale. (Two traps: `geometryForSpriteAtIndex:` returns a struct much larger than its
 * truncated encoding claims, so a snug sret buffer smashes the stack; and `-sizeForItem:` segfaults
 * without a data source.)
 *
 * | ivar | value |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | `_stackedItemsCount` | **4** — cards *behind* the front one, so **five** are drawn |
 * | `_normalizedStackSizeTransform` | **0.9** |
 * | `_normalizedStackHorizontalOffsets` | **[0.0666667, 0.0483333, 0.0333333, 0.03]** |
 * | `_rotationAngle` | **0.03490658 rad = 2.0°**, accumulating, **always toward +x** |
 * | `_minItemAspectRatio` / `_maxItemAspectRatio` | **0.75 / 1.3333** |
 * | `_itemCornerRadius` | **20** |
 * | `_verticalContentInsets` | **15**, and it insets the **square**, not the balloon |
 *
 * **The layout box, and why it is *not* a square.** `-[CKGenericPhotoStackBalloonView layoutSubviews]`
 * disassembles to one rule, with no `min()`, no square and no centring in it:
 *
 *     frame = (bounds.x, bounds.y - d, bounds.w, bounds.h + 2d),  d = stackBalloonVerticalInset - smallTranscriptSpace
 *
 * pixel-snapped afterwards (the y floored, then all four rounded). `d` is **9** on iPhone and **11**
 * on Mac, which is exactly half of `photoStackBox.heightInset`. Swept: a 400×200 balloon gives
 * (0, −9, 400, 218) and a 200×400 balloon gives (0, −9, 200, 418) — the box simply follows the
 * balloon's own width and outsets its height.
 *
 * It comes out *square* at the balloon sizes this kit actually draws only because
 * `previewBalloonSizeThatFits:` sets `h = w - 2d`, so `w` and `h + 2d` are the same number there —
 * and the earlier reading of this ("a square of side = the balloon's width, vertically centred")
 * could not tell the two apart from that one data point. It matters the moment the balloon is
 * clamped narrower than its natural width, which is exactly when this file used to fall apart.
 *
 * The cards then live in an `S × S` square anchored at that box's **top-left**, `S = min(w, h)` of
 * the box — not centred in it. At the natural size the two are the same; at 200×400 the cards sit in
 * the top 200×200 rather than at the box's middle.
 *
 * **The card.** `aspect-fit(clamp(photoAspect, 0.75, 1.3333))` into `(S - 30)²`. With no photo aspect
 * known it is 0.75 — a **portrait** card, not the near-square this file used to draw. Swept: at
 * `minItemAspectRatio` 0.4 and 0.6 the sprite box stayed at aspect 0.75; at 0.8 it became 0.8. The
 * container's own aspect never enters into it.
 *
 * **The arch.** Every card shares the square's centre y, and card *k* has centre
 * `x = S/2 + S · Σ offsets[0..k)`. The offsets are successive deltas, and their denominator is the
 * square's side — `dx₁/S` came back 0.066666667 in all 40 rows of the sweep while `dx₁/cardWidth`
 * wandered over 0.0733…0.1170. Scale is `0.9ᵏ` and rotation `+2k°`; **neither is mirrored for an
 * outgoing message**, which is the part this file used to get backwards. Its `lean = -1` reproduced
 * the framework's *leading* keyframes (175.31, 151.94, 134.99, 123.30) — the paged-past half of the

 * separate probe *inside the simulator* — a different view, configured with that flag YES — found the
 * card size identical for 0.75, 1.0 and 1.5 images, i.e. a hard-wired 3:4. Both readings are of real
 * objects; they are of different objects. The card's painted corner follows the same reasoning: the
 * sprite style reports radius 20 on every sprite and the scale is applied on top, so the painted
 * corner is `20 · 0.9ᵏ`, which is what a scaled element gives for free.
 *
 * **Still not measured**, and marked as such where it is used: the colour of the per-depth overlay
 * (`overlayAlpha` is 0.1·k in the geometry, but the sprite style carries no colour, so the item
 * effect view must paint it); and where the "+N Items" accessory card sits — `setAdditionalItemsCount:`
 * raises on a layout with no data source, and all that is established is that it is an *accessory*
 * item (`numberOfAccessoryItems`), structurally separate from the five photo slots, so it does not
 * consume one. `PXMessagesStackAdditionalItemsView` is a `UIBlurEffect` behind a centred SF Bold 17
 * label in systemBlue, and `_localizedTitleForAdditionalItemsCount:` is where "+2 Items" comes from.
 *
 * What all this replaces was first a 2×2 grid — which Messages does not draw at all, there is no
 * photo-grid balloon on either idiom — and then a mirrored four-card fan of near-square cards.

 *   obvious 20 (`bubbleMetrics.macos.edgeInset`) gives 383.5 — a whole point wider than the capture.
 *
 * That 1.0 pt is unresolved and is the reason the measured constant, not this formula, is still the
 * default: swapping it in would move every macOS bubble by a point on the strength of a guessed
 * inset. `shouldCoverSendButton` is the only flag that changes the answer, and it is the composer's

            What is measured: `PXMessagesStackAdditionalItemsView` is a `UIBlurEffect` behind a centred
            SF Bold 17 label in systemBlue, `_localizedTitleForAdditionalItemsCount:` produces the
            string, and the card is an *accessory* item — `numberOfAccessoryItems`, separate from the
            photo sprites — so it does not take a photo's place in the fan.

            What is NOT measured, and this is the honest part: WHERE it sits.
            `-[PXMessagesStackView setAdditionalItemsCount:]` raises on a layout with no data source,
            so its frame could not be read. What this draws is therefore a placement, not a
            measurement — a pill on the front card, in the bottom corner away from the tail so it
            collides with neither the tail nor the fan. It replaces a version that put the count in
            the deepest fan slot, where it rendered *zero* device pixels at 3x: the front card covered
            the label completely, a wedge 1.76 pt wide was all the card ever showed, and three, five
            and ten photos came out pixel-identical. An unmeasured position that can be read beats a
            measured-looking one that cannot.

            The material follows the page colour rather than a hardcoded light fill, since which
            `UIBlurEffect` style it uses is unmeasured too; `--im-stack-more` overrides it. */}
