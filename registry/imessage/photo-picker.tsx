/**
 * The Photos picker iOS 26 opens inside the Messages composer.
 *
 * ## Provenance, in the order this repo prefers it
 *
 * **1. Measured, from `references/ios/captures/photo-picker-light.png`** (iOS 26.0, iPhone 17 Pro,
 * 402x874 pt at 3x). Device pixels are quoted wherever the point value is a third.
 *
 * A white panel, inset **5.3333 (16 px)** from the screen's left, right and bottom edges, holding a
 * three-column grid of thumbnails flush to its own left, right and top edges. Over the middle of the
 * first row sits a drag grabber. That is the whole of what the capture shows: **no header, no title,
 * no "Recents" label, no Albums button, no camera tile, no search field, no send or count button,
 * and no selection badge on any tile.** The last one is a measurement in its own right and this file
 * relies on it: an unselected tile in this picker carries no empty ring, unlike the Photos app's
 * select mode, so the badge is only ever drawn on a selected tile.
 *
 * The capture shows two rows with empty white under them. That is the library, not the layout: the
 * simulator ships six sample photos. The grid scrolls vertically; at this panel height a third row
 * would be visible for 121.3 of its 129.56.
 *
 * | Part | Value | How |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | Inset (left, right, bottom) | 5.3333 (16 px) | white run x 16-1189, bottom-most white row 2605 of 2622 |
 * | Width at a 402 screen | 391.3333 | 1174 px |
 * | Top / height in the capture | 485 / 383.6667 | grid top 1455 px, panel bottom 2606 px |
 * | Fill | `#ffffff` | flat, sampled all over the empty area below the grid |
 * | Top corners | superellipse n 2.204, R **39.0** (rms 0.84 px) | 109 sub-pixel boundary points, top-right |
 * | Bottom corners | superellipse n 2.204, R **57.5833** (rms 0.90 px) | 183 points, bottom-left |
 * | Shadow / dim | none | the blurred backdrop reads a flat 244-246 right up to the panel edge |
 * | Grid gap | 1.6207 (4.862 px) | three independent seam fits: 4.870, 4.859 across, 4.858 down |
 * | Tile | 129.364 x 129.5633 | columns average 388.09 device px, rows 388.69 |
 * | Tile corner | **2.3** | see below |
 * | Grabber | **35 x 4.6667**, top **5.0**, centred | see below |
 * | Composer above it | field bottom 463.6667, so 21.3333 of backdrop above the panel | the composer stays *full*: `+`, "iMessage" and the mic are all still drawn, unlike the plus-menu state |
 *
 * The plain circle is fitted separately, because it is what the panel actually renders (see the
 * clip-path note in the panel's own style): **36.1667** top (rms 0.94 px) and **53.5** bottom (rms
 * 1.27 px). The bottom corner is the device's own corner made concentric with the panel: 57.58 + 5.33
 * = 62.9, the iPhone 17 Pro display radius.
 *
 * **The grabber, re-measured.** A 2D area fit over 2640 pixels of the capture (a rounded rect whose
 * five parameters are solved at once against the sub-pixel coverage, with the local background
 * modelled per column between the clean rows above and below the pill) puts it at
 * **105.000 x 14.000 device px**, its top **15.000 px** below the panel top, centred on x 603.000
 * against a panel centre of 603.000, rms 0.028 of coverage. That is 35 x 4.6667 at top 5.0. The
 * width and the height hold at exactly 105.000 and 14.000 whatever corner radius the fit is given,
 * and rows 1469 and 1484 carry *zero* ink at every x sampled, so there is no anti-aliased rim to
 * subtract: the pill is 14 device px tall, not 15. The corner is shallow to fit (rms 0.0255 at 6.4
 * device px, 0.0307 at 7.0); a capsule, radius = height / 2 = 2.3333, sits in that band and is what
 * the framework draws, so that is what this file uses.
 *
 * This supersedes the `-[_UIGrabber intrinsicContentSize]` value of `{36, 5}` that this file and
 * `sticker-picker.tsx` used to carry. A Catalyst probe confirms the framework number is real -
 * `_UIGrabber` is 36 x 5 at `cornerRadius` 2.5 with two full-bleed subviews that inset nothing, and
 * `-[CKAppGrabberView layoutSubviews]` places one at **y 5.0**, horizontally centred, in a
 * 391.3333-wide header - so the *top* agrees with the capture exactly. The size does not: 36 x 5 at
 * 3x is 108 x 15 device px against a measured 105 x 14, and 105/108 = 0.972 while 14/15 = 0.933, so
 * it is not a scaled `_UIGrabber` either. Per this repo's rule the capture wins.
 *
 * **The tile corner, re-measured.** Nine tile corners that meet clean white (the bottom row's
 * bottom edges and both sides of every gap junction) were each fitted with the same 2D coverage
 * model, taking the photo colour from a plane fitted to the tile's own interior. sRGB blending fits
 * better than linear (mean rms 0.168 against 0.207), and the nine circles come out 6.55 to 7.97
 * device px: median 6.87, rms-weighted mean 6.94. So **2.3** (6.9 device px), with a spread of about
 * +/-0.2 pt corner to corner. The 2.1 this file used to carry sits under the whole cluster, and the
 * **12** `SPEC.md` line 164 still records is 36 device px against a measured 6.9 - off by a factor
 * of five, and copied from there into `group-details.tsx` and `ios-details.tsx`.
 *
 * **2. From the frameworks**, by the Catalyst probe this repo uses elsewhere: `clang -target
 * arm64-apple-ios26.0-macabi`, dlopen
 * `/System/iOSSupport/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/PhotosUICore.framework/PhotosUICore`, swizzle
 * `-[UIDevice userInterfaceIdiom]` to Phone.
 *
 * | Value | Where |
 * |---|---|
 * | selection badge box **26 x 26** | `+[PXSelectionBadgeUIViewTile preferredSize]` |
 * | badge **3.5** trailing and **3.5** bottom inside the cell | `-[PUPhotosGridCell layoutSubviews]` at a 129.364 x 129.5633 cell: badge frame `{99.864, 100.0633, 26, 26}` |
 * | badge ink **O 22.0**, white rim **1.5449**, blue disc **O 18.9102**, fill **#0088ff** | the badge is a `UIImage`, and its `CGImage` is 52 x 52 at scale 2, so it is read at that native size rather than upscaled. The alpha edge is hard: the disc spans exactly 44 of the 52 px in both axes and in both centre rows and columns. The rim integrates to 3.0898 px of white coverage inward from that edge; the blue is exactly `rgb(0 136 255)`, the kit's measured iOS blue |
 * | check stroke **1.4248**, vertices (-4.408, 0.941) (-1.334, 4.670) (3.957, -3.645) from the badge centre | a seven-parameter least-squares fit of a round-capped, round-joined polyline against the white coverage of 928 pixels of that same native image, supersampled 8 x 8: rms 0.0125 of coverage |
 *
 * Because the badge sits 3.5 inside a 26 box whose ink is 22, the visible disc is **5.5** from the
 * tile's trailing and bottom edges, which is what `badge.inset` records.
 *
 * The search row, if the expanded detent draws one, reuses `sticker-picker.tsx`'s framework numbers
 * (row 44, field 34, SF Medium 17, `tertiarySystemFill`), which this file's own probe re-read:
 * `+[UIColor tertiarySystemFillColor]` is `rgb(118 118 128 / 0.12)` light and `/ 0.24` dark.
 *
 * **3. Not measured, and not measurable from here.** Everything in this group is marked
 * `@unverified` on the metric that carries it and is listed in the component's return.
 *
 * - **The dark palette.** No dark capture of this surface exists, and the Catalyst probe cannot
 *   stand in for one: under Catalyst the colour catalog is the *macOS* one whatever the idiom trait
 *   says. `+[UIColor systemBackgroundColor]` resolves dark to `#1e1e1e` (iOS is `#000000`) and
 *   `secondarySystemBackgroundColor` resolves light to `#ececec` (iOS is `#f2f2f7`), so a dark value
 *   read that way would be a macOS value wearing an iOS label. The panel is `#ffffff` in light,
 *   which is `systemBackground` and `secondarySystemGroupedBackground` alike, and those two part
 *   company in dark (`#000000` against `#1c1c1e`) - so even the *right* token is undecided. The dark
 *   set below is a guess and says so.
 * - **Both easing curves and both durations.** 380 ms open and 220 ms exit are borrowed from the
 *   long-press menu's measured pair, the same borrow `ios-plus-menu.tsx` and `sticker-picker.tsx`
 *   make; the curves are invented. Nothing in `references/` records this panel moving. The panel
 *   translates and does **not** fade: the away pose clears the screen on its own (`height + inset`,
 *   so the panel top lands exactly on the screen's bottom edge), which is what an iOS sheet does,
 *   and the fade this file used to run was covering an away pose that left 5.3 pt on screen.
 * - **The expanded detent and everything in it**: its height, the header, the "Recents" title, the
 *   Albums button and the search row's placement. The capture is of the collapsed detent and shows
 *   none of them, so this is a missing *state*, not a wrong pixel. The drag itself, its 24 pt handle
 *   strip and the halfway snap are judgement too.
 * - **The composer attachment chip** (`PhotoPickerAttachments`). No capture in either directory
 *   shows a selection sitting in the composer, and no ChatKit metric describes it -
 *   `-[CKUIBehaviorPhone entryViewAttachmentHorizontalOffset]` is -5 and the vertical one is 0,
 *   which places something without sizing it. Every number on the chip is invented.
 * - **The ordered badge's number**, and the 150 ms the badge scales in over.

/**
 * # The macOS presentation
 *
 * macOS Messages does not put the Photos browser in a sheet. The "+" is a **menu** there and not the
 * iPhone's app strip — `-[CKUIBehaviorMac browserButtonShouldUseMenu]` is YES where the Phone's is
 * NO, and `entryViewSupportsBrowserButton` is NO on both — so its "Photos" row opens a **popover
 * anchored to the "+" button**, sized to its content and wearing the window's own material. Nothing
 * about the iOS panel survives that: no grabber, no detents, no sheet corners, no bottom-edge inset,
 * and no slide up from the screen's bottom edge, which in a desktop window put a sliver of tiles
 * below the window itself.
 *
 * ## Measured — ChatKit 26.5 at idiom 5
 *
 * A Catalyst probe (`clang -target arm64-apple-ios26.0-macabi`, dlopen ChatKit, `-[UIDevice
 * userInterfaceIdiom]` swizzled to 5 **before** anything latches it) then `+[CKUIBehavior
 * sharedBehaviors]`, which vends `CKUIBehaviorMac`. The idiom-0 reading is beside each one, because
 * the Mac does not inherit the Phone and the pair is the whole point:
 *
 * | Selector | idiom 5 (Mac) | idiom 0 (Phone) |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `popOverWidth` | **252** | absent |
 * | `popOverMaxHeight` | **400** | absent |
 * | `popoverPadding` | **7** | absent |
 * | `popoverHeightPadding` | **16** | absent |
 * | `attachmentBrowserGridSectionInset` | {8, 8} | {8, 8} |
 * | `attachmentBrowserGridInterItemSpacing` | 4 | 4 |
 * | `attachmentBrowserGridMinimumLineSpacing` | 4 | 4 |
 * | `attachmentBrowserDefaultSizeForSquare` | **{104, 104}** | **{72.5, 72.5}** |
 * | `searchPhotosCellCornerRadius` | **8** | **0** |
 *
 * Two readings in that table are narrower than they look, and both are recorded rather than hidden.
 * `attachmentBrowserDefaultSizeForSquare` returns a `CGSize`, not a scalar - it is square, so the
 * one number is the whole of it, but the selector is not a length. And `searchPhotosCellCornerRadius`
 * names the cell in *search*, not the attachment browser's; nothing on either class names the
 * browser tile's corner, so 8 is that neighbour's radius borrowed, which is why the tile carries it
 * as a `clip-path` and not as a measured token.
 *
 * There is **no** photo-specific popover selector on either class: the whole
 * `browser|picker|popover|photo|grid|sticker` selector list on `CKUIBehaviorMac` and on the base
 * `CKUIBehavior` was dumped and holds no `photoPopoverSize` or `browserPopoverSize`. So the Photos
 * row takes the generic Mac popover, 252 x 400, and that is what `width` / `maxHeight` are.
 *
 * The **chrome** is the one macOS popover a capture in this repo does hold: the fill, the bright
 * inset rim, the dark hairline outside it and the 12 pt corner `macos-plus-menu.tsx` measured off
 * `references/macos/captures/plus-menu-{light,dark}-2x.png`. Those values are copied here rather
 * than imported, so this file stays a registry item with no dependency of its own — the same copy
 * `macos-messages-app.tsx` keeps, for the same reason.
 *
 * The **anchor** is measured too, at one remove: `macos-plus-menu.tsx` puts the menu's left edge on
 * the "+" button's left edge at pane x 9 and its top edge 3 pt inside the button's bottom at pane
 * y 626, which places the button's bottom at 629; `macos-composer.tsx` measures the button 30 square
 * with its own bottom 11 above the composer's, so the button is `{9, 599, 30, 30}` in a 640 pt pane
 * and sits **41 pt above the pane's bottom edge**. That last form is what `anchor` records, because
 * it is the one that survives a pane of another height. At run time the button is *found* rather
 * than assumed — see `useMacPopoverPlacement` — so a caller that moves it keeps the arrow.
 *
 * ## Derived, not read
 *
 * - **Columns.** 252 less `popoverPadding` on each side is 238; less the grid's own 8 pt section
 *   inset on each side is 222. At the measured 104 square and 4 pt spacing that is
 *   `floor((222 + 4) / 108)` = **2** columns, and the tiles then stretch to 109 to fill the row.
 *   The stretch is the rule this file's iOS grid already follows (its 5 columns of 72.73 come out of
 *   ChatKit's 72.5 the same way), not a new invention — but the 109 itself is arithmetic, not a
 *   reading.
 * - **Height.** `popoverHeightPadding` = 16 is measured; that it is 8 above and 8 below rather than
 *   16 of something else is an assumption. The box is the grid's own height plus that 16, capped at
 *   the measured `popOverMaxHeight`, which is what "sized to its content" means here.
 *
 * ## Not measured, and marked
 *
 * - **The arrow.** No capture in `references/macos/captures` holds a Messages attachment popover.
 *   ChatKit has no arrow metric. UIKit's own `+[_UIPopoverStandardChromeView arrowHeight]` reads
 *   **0** under Catalyst, because AppKit draws the chrome there, and AppKit exposes none
 *   (`_NSPopoverFrame` does not exist in macOS 26). So the arrow's size and its outline are
 *   invented. Where it *points* is measured — the "+" button's centre — except that a 12 pt corner
 *   will not let a 22 pt arrow sit closer than 23 pt to the box's edge, so at this anchor the tip
 *   lands 8 pt right of the button's centre. That clamp is what UIKit does too.
 * - **The motion.** Borrowed whole from `macPlusMenuMetrics.motion`, which is itself borrowed: 160
 *   ms in, 120 ms out, from 0.96 at the anchor corner. Nothing records this popover opening.
 * - **The tile aspect.** The iOS capture's tiles are 0.6 device px taller than they are wide; the
 *   Mac square is `attachmentBrowserDefaultSizeForSquare`, so these are square. That is a reading of
 *   the selector's name, not of a capture.
