/**
 * The **Tapback Details platter**: the horizontal list of who reacted, with one tally per reaction
 * kind across the front, presented when you tap a tapback badge or pick "Tapback Details…".
 *
 * **NO CAPTURE OF THIS PLATTER EXISTS**, on either platform, so nothing below was read off a frame of
 * it. It is built from ChatKit 26.5 — the framework macOS Messages is a Catalyst app of — read out of
 * the live runtime on 2026-09-08 with a Mac Catalyst probe (`clang -target arm64-apple-ios26.0-macabi`,
 * `dlopen` of `/System/iOSSupport/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ChatKit.framework/ChatKit`, swizzle
 * `-[UIDevice userInterfaceIdiom]`, then `objc_msgSend` on the getters named below), cross-checked
 * against the on-disk simulator copy of the same framework
 * (`…/iOS 26.0.simruntime/Contents/Resources/RuntimeRoot/…/ChatKit.framework/ChatKit`, whose symbol
 * table is intact and disassembles). Every value states its selector.
 *
 * ChatKit calls it the **voting view**: `-[CKUIBehavior messageAcknowledgementVotingViewHeight]` and
 * its two neighbours size the platter, and the Swift type `ChatKit.StyleSupport` carries the interior
 * as class constants (`+votingViewCellWidth` and the rest). Its strings are ChatKit's own, from
 * `ChatKit.framework/Resources/ChatKit.loctable` (`en`): `TAPBACK_DETAILS_ELLIPSIS` = "Tapback
 * Details…" is the menu row, `TAPBACK_DETAILS` = "Tapback Details" the title,
 * `ACCESSIBILITY_TAPBACK_LABEL` = "%@ reacted with %@" the cell,
 * `ACCESSIBILITY_EXPANDED_TAPBACK_FORMAT` = "%lu %@ reactions from %@" the tally,
 * `ACCESSIBILITY_TAPBACK_OVERFLOW_STRING` = "Others" the tail of a long name list, and
 * `REMOVE_TAPBACK_INTENT_TITLE` = "Remove Tapback" the action on your own cell.
 *
 * **Mac numbers are ChatKit's Mac numbers, 1:1. There is no Catalyst point scale.** An earlier version
 * of this file multiplied every macOS value by 0.77; that was wrong and the repo's own captures
 * falsify it three times over. `StyleSupport`'s constants are idiom-independent (one value, both
 * platforms); only `CKUIBehavior` differs by idiom, and its idiom pairs land on measured captures with
 * no scaling at all: `conversationListContactImageDiameter` 45 Phone / 40 Mac against SPEC's measured
 * Ø45 iOS row avatar and Ø40 macOS sidebar avatar; `conversationListSummaryFont` 15 / 12 against
 * SPEC's 15pt iOS preview and 12pt macOS preview; `balloonTextFont` 17 / 13 against SPEC's 17pt iOS
 * bubble text and 13pt macOS bubble text.
 *
 * **The layout is a horizontal platter, not a table.** `votingViewPlatterCornerRadius` = 34 round (all
 * but a capsule at `messageAcknowledgementVotingViewHeight` 72 iOS / 80 Mac), holding one
 * `votingViewCellWidth` = 64 wide cell per reactor: a `votingViewAvatarDiameter` = 44 avatar badged
 * with the reaction in a `votingViewAvatarViewGlyphFrame` 20 square, then
 * `votingViewAvatarToTextSpacing` = 4 and a `votingViewAvatarViewLabelHeight` = 18 name. One
 * `votingViewExpandedTally` 27 square per reaction kind leads the row with its count beside it
 * (`votingViewTallyLabelSpacing` = 0), and a close button trails everything at
 * `votingViewCloseButtonLeftPadding` = 22. `votingViewAdditionalTopInset` = 4 tops the content, which
 * with 4 + 44 + 4 + 18 = 70 fits the 72 iOS height with 2 to spare (10 on Mac's 80; ChatKit does not
 * say where that slack goes, so the content is top-aligned and it falls at the bottom).
 *
 * **The glyphs are glyphs, not balloons.** ChatKit names a balloon a balloon everywhere else
 * (`messageAcknowledgmentTranscriptBalloonSize`, `aggregateAcknowledgmentTranscriptBalloonSize`,
 * `messageAcknowledgmentPickerBarAcknowledgmentItemBalloonSize`); here it names a *glyph frame* and a
 * *tally*, so the badge and the tally draw the bare artwork with no circle behind it. What fills such
 * a frame comes from ChatKit's own balloon-to-glyph arithmetic checked against this repo's measured
 * ink, in `tapbackGlyphInk` below.
 *
 * **Presentation.** `-[CKChatController(ClickyOrbConformance) _votingViewForChatItem:containingViewController:]`
 * builds a `CKAttributionViewAccessoryView` sized `attributionViewHeight` = 132 by the safe layout
 * frame's width less the system layout margins, and `-[CKFullScreenBalloonViewControllerPhone
 * votingViewTargetFrame]` places it at x = the leading margin, y = `max(attributionViewMinPadding = 6,
 * the tapback's own frame origin y)` — i.e. **an overlay anchored near the top of the transcript at the
 * message, not a bottom sheet**. The platter itself shrink-wraps inside that box up to
 * `messageAcknowledgementVotingViewMaxWidth` (400 iOS / 500 Mac) and keeps
 * `messageAcknowledgementVotingViewMinPadding` (8 iOS / 6 Mac) from the presenting edge.
 *
 * **What is JUDGEMENT, and is marked so below:** the close button's size (ChatKit gives it a left
 * padding and no size), where the 20 square badge sits on the avatar vertically, whether
 * `votingViewItemSpacing` applies between cells as well as between tallies, the presentation's
 * durations and curves, and the filter behaviour of the tallies.
 *
 * Not to be confused with `message-actions.tsx`'s `TapbackDetails`, which is the *collapsed* form of
 * the same ChatKit view family and **is** captured: `CKTapbackAttributionView`, the 124 × 121 glass
 * card with a balloon over the reactor's avatar that floats above a long-pressed message you have
 * already reacted to (`references/ios/captures/longpress-ok-selected-{light,dark}.png`). That file
 * owns the name `tapbackDetailsMetrics` and the slot `data-slot="tapback-details"`; everything here is
 * named `…Platter` and slotted `tapback-details-platter` so the two never collide in one overlay.
