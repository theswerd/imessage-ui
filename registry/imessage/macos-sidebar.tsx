/**
 * macOS 26 Messages conversation list. Every number is measured from a native 960×640 window at 2x
 * (see `references/SPEC.md` → macOS Chrome). The sidebar is not a flat 330 pt column: it is a floating
 * panel inset 8 from the window's left, top and bottom, 320 wide (window x 8–328), radius ≈18, with a
 * 1 pt bright rim and a soft shadow onto the pane. Everything inside sits in window coordinates:
 * search field x 18–318 y 52–88 (a 36 tall capsule), pinned Ø73 avatar centered (168, 142.5) with an
 * 11 pt gray label, rows 80.5 tall from y 215 with a Ø40 avatar at x 36–76, a 13 pt semibold name
 * (baseline 28.75 into the row), a 12 pt time on the same baseline ending at x 307.5, a 12 pt preview
 * (baseline 45, 15 pt line pitch, two lines), 1 pt separators from x 82 to 306, a #3478f6 selection
 * (#3a3a3a when the window is not key) and a 49 pt footer bar at the panel's bottom.
 *
 * **Unread** (no capture; read out of ChatKit 26.5 on macOS 26.5, the framework macOS Messages is
 * built on). An unread row draws a dot and nothing else: nothing in the row's layout moves, no label
 * changes weight or colour, and there is no count badge.
 * - Ø **9**, from `-[CKUIBehaviorMac unreadIndicatorImageViewSize]` = `{9, 9}`. The asset behind it,
 *   `-[CKUIBehavior unreadIndicatorTintedImage]`, is a Ø12 circle that fills its box edge to edge, so
 *   the image view's size *is* the dot's diameter.
 * - Fill **#0088ff light / #0091ff dark, opaque**, from `-[CKUIThemeMac unreadIndicatorColor]`.
 *   `__42-[CKUIBehavior unreadIndicatorTintedImage]_block_invoke` is that colour's only consumer:
 *   it bakes it into the circle, and rendering the image under each appearance returns those two.
 * - Placement `-[CKConversationListCellLayout unreadFrame]` = `{4.5, y, 9, 9}` in the same row space
 *   whose avatar is `{18, ·, 40, 40}` and whose name box starts at 64, i.e. exactly this component's.
 *   `-[CKConversationListStandardCell _calculateIndicatorFrameForSize:trailing:displayScale:insets:]`
 *   derives both: x = (`conversationListCellLeftMargin` 18 − 9) / 2 = 4.5, so the dot is centred in the
 *   gutter left of the avatar, and y = (row height − 9) / 2, so it is centred on the row.
 * - **Selected and unread**: the dot turns **white**, opaque. `-[CKUIBehaviorMac
 *   shouldUnreadIndicatorChangeOnSelection]` is `YES` (it is `NO` on `CKUIBehaviorPhone`), and
 *   `-[CKConversationListCell unreadIndicatorImageForVisibility:withMuteState:]` reads
 *   `shouldLabelsBeHighlighted && shouldUnreadIndicatorChangeOnSelection ? unreadIndicatorSelectedImage
 *   : unreadIndicatorTintedImage`. The selected image renders #ffffff in both appearances. It is the
 *   same test that whitens the labels, because the dot sits inside the selection fill, not beside it,
 *   so the dot follows `highlighted` here. `shouldLabelsBeHighlighted` is a bare ivar on the cell with
 *   no notion of a key window, so an inactive window's gray selection is the one case not settled by
 *   the framework: the capture shows its labels staying dark, and the dot stays blue to match.
 * - **No count.** `_TtC7ChatKit32CKConversationListIndicatorsView`, the row's accessory strip, holds
 *   only image views, and `-[CKConversationListCell unreadMessageCount]` is read by nothing that
 *   draws. A number passed here is announced and never painted.
 * - **A pinned conversation** draws the same dot before its title label. `CKPinnedConversationView`
 *   vends `unreadIndicatorSize` {9, 9} and `unreadIndicatorPreferredPadding` trailing **3**, and laying
 *   a 96 × 119 one out (the tile size this component uses) puts the label at x 15.5 w 65.5 y 90 h 19
 *   and the dot at x 3.5 y 95, i.e. the label stays centred in the tile and the dot hangs off its
 *   leading edge 3 away, vertically centred on the label's line. `_unreadIndicatorColor` picks between
 *   three colours and both of its branches are now settled:
 *   `isFilteredByFocus ? conversationListPinnedConversationFilteredByFocusIndicatorColor
 *    : isSelectedWithDarkAppearance ? readSelectedIndicatorColor : unreadIndicatorColor`.
 *   `isFilteredByFocus` is set from `-[CKConversationList updateFilteredByFocusStateForConversations:]`,
 *   the "a Focus is filtering this conversation out" dimming; this kit has no Focus, so it is always NO
 *   and the #000000@25.9% / #ffffff@24.7% colour it would pick is unreachable. `isSelectedWithDarkAppearance`
 *   is written in exactly one place, `-[CKPinnedConversationCollectionViewCell updateConfigurationUsingState:]`,
 *   as `useSelectedAppearanceForConversationCellState:traitCollection: && showsBackgroundViewWhenSelected`,
 *   and `-[CKUIBehaviorMac useSelectedAppearanceForConversationCellState:traitCollection:]` is
 *   `(state.isSelected || state.cellDropState == 2) && traitCollection.activeAppearance.isMainWindowForegroundActive`.
 *   So the name means "selected on the key window, while the tile paints its selected background", and
 *   `readSelectedIndicatorColor` is opaque **#ffffff** in both appearances, the same white the row dot
 *   takes. This component's pinned selection is a ring around the avatar, not the filled radius-8
 *   background view native draws (`conversationListPinnedCellSelectedBackgroundCornerRadius` 8), and
 *   its label does not go white either, so the second term is NO here and the dot always takes
 *   `unreadIndicatorColor`. Give the tile that background and the white branch turns on with it.
 *
 * **The row's four states: rest, hover, pressed, selected.**
 *
 * *Selected* is the measured one: fill **#3478f6** on the key window, **`--sb-inactive`** when it is
 * not, with the labels, the muted bell and the unread dot going white only in the first case (see
 * `active` below). Both come from the full-window frames "macOS Chrome" is measured from.
 *
 * *Hover draws nothing, and that is the reading, not a gap.* Four independent sources say so:
 * - `references/SPEC.md`, from the live session the sidebar numbers come from: "**No hover state**
 *   on sidebar rows or bubbles."
 * - `CKUIThemeMac` has no conversation-list hover, pressed or cell colour at all. Dumping every
 *   zero-argument `UIColor` getter on it (86 of them) turns up `conversationListCellSelectedText/
 *   Summary/DateColor` and nothing that could fill a row; `conversationListCellColor` and
 *   `conversationListSelectedCellColor` are both **null** on the Mac theme, where the phone theme
 *   answers #dcdcdc / #464646 and the Pad theme #0088ff / #0091ff.
 * - `+[UIBackgroundConfiguration listSidebarCellConfiguration]` and `listPlainCellConfiguration`,
 *   resolved for every combination of `highlighted` and `selected` at idiom 5, change **only** for
 *   `selected`. `highlighted` alone is byte-identical to rest in both appearances.
 * - ChatKit does implement hover — `appMenuCollectionViewCell:didHoverWithState:`,
 *   `contactsCell:didHoverWithState:` — for the app drawer and the contacts list, and for no cell in
 *   the conversation list. It is absent here on purpose, not by omission.
 *
 * So the hover fill is `--sb-row-hover`, and it is **`transparent`**. It is a seam rather than a
 * value: a product that wants a web-idiomatic hover sets that one custom property and gets it on
 * unselected, unpressed rows only. Nothing in this kit sets it, because native does not.
 *
 * *Pressed* is the selected look, arriving a beat early. `CKConversationListCell` is a
 * **`UITableViewCell`** (not a collection-view cell) whose `selectionStyle` is `Default`, and a
 * `UITableViewCell` paints the same `selectedBackgroundView` for `highlighted` as for `selected` —
 * so a row under a held mouse wears the row's own selected fill, and no second colour is invented.
 * The click still commits on release, and a press that wanders off the row before then puts the
 * fill out again.
 *
 * **UNMEASURED, and the one place this departs from the framework's own answer**: the *labels* go
 * white under the press too. `-[CKUIBehaviorMac useSelectedAppearanceForConversationCellState:
 * traitCollection:]` is `(state.isSelected || state.cellDropState == 2) && …isMainWindowForeground
 * Active` — it never reads `isHighlighted`, so on ChatKit's reading a held row would keep its dark
 * labels over the blue. No capture holds a pressed row to settle it, and dark-on-#3478f6 is not
 * something any macOS list draws, so the whole selected appearance travels together here.
 *
 * **Search** (`onSearch`, `searchQuery`). Typing in the field replaces the list *in place*:
 * `-[CKUIBehaviorMac searchControllerObscuresConversationList]` is **NO**, where the same selector on
 * `CKUIBehaviorPhone` is **YES** — which is why iOS covers its whole screen (`ios-search.tsx`) and the
 * Mac does not. The pinned strip goes with the list, a "Conversations" header takes its place, and
 * the rows underneath are the sidebar's own measured 80.5 rows, unchanged. Every number in
 * `macSidebarMetrics.results` is a Catalyst probe reading off `CKUIBehaviorMac` in ChatKit 26.5, with
 * the Phone value beside it so the two idioms can be told apart; what is **not** measured is where the
 * header sits horizontally (it takes the rows' own leading edge) and the "No Results" line, because no
 * capture in `references/macos/captures` holds a search in progress. The kit's own strings are used
 * verbatim: `SEARCH_CONVERSATIONS_TITLE` "Conversations" and `SEARCH_RESULTS_INDEXING_TITLE`
 * "No Results". ⌘F reaches the field from the window; that binding lives in `macos-messages-app.tsx`.
 *
 * **What the match looks like, settled out of ChatKit 26.5 rather than guessed.** A conversation
 * result on the Mac is `+[CKConversationSearchResultCell conversationListCellClass]` =
 * `CKConversationSearchResultEmbeddedCell`, a `CKConversationListStandardCell` subclass — this row.
 * Disassembling `-[CKConversationSearchResultEmbeddedCell configureWithQueryResult:searchText:]`
 * settles all three questions a highlight raises:
 * - **Which label.** It lets the base cell fill the row (`updateContentsForConversation:fastPreview:`
 *   between two `setFreezeSummaryText:` calls), then sends `-setAttributedText:` to **`summaryLabel`
 *   only**. The name label is never annotated, so a query that matches only a name shows no emphasis
 *   anywhere in the row. This component annotates the preview line and leaves the name alone.
 * - **Not bolded.** One font is fetched — `searchMessageBodyTextFont` when
 *   `CKIsRunningInMacCatalyst()` (which macOS Messages is), `conversationListSummaryFont` otherwise —
 *   and handed to
 *   `+annotatedResultStringWithSearchText:resultText:primaryTextColor:primaryFont:annotatedTextColor:annotatedFont:`
 *   as **both** the primary and the annotated font: the two argument registers are literally the same
 *   register (x5 and x7 are both x23). The match is recoloured and nothing else. That is the same
 *   thing `-[CKMessageSearchResultCell _annotatedResultStringForResult:searchText:]` does on iOS, and
 *   it is why `ios-search.tsx` recolours too.
 * - **Which two colours.** `primaryTextColor` is `theme.conversationListSummaryColor` and
 *   `annotatedTextColor` is `theme.conversationListSenderColor` — the row's own preview colour and
 *   the row's own **name** colour, the two this component already has measured off the capture as
 *   `--sb-secondary` and `--sb-name`. (`CKUIThemeMac` resolves them to black at 49.8% / 84.7% in
 *   light and white at 54.9% / 84.7% in dark; the capture's own #6e6e6d and #000000 win, because a
 *   capture beats a framework constant.) On a selected row the same pair becomes
 *   `conversationListCellSelectedSummaryColor` white@80% and `conversationListCellSelectedTextColor`
 *   white, so the match goes to the plain #ffffff the name takes there.
 *
 * `searchMessageBodyTextFont` is SF Regular **15** on `CKUIBehaviorMac`, against the 12 pt preview
 * this row measures. It is **not** applied: `conversationListSenderFont` is Semibold 17 on the same
 * class against a measured 13, so ChatKit's conversation-list font table is already known to
 * disagree with macOS 26's own sidebar. Only the structure above — one font, two colours, summary
 * label only — is taken from the framework; every size stays the capture's.
 *
 * **UNMEASURED: the clear button.** No capture holds a field with text in it, so the ✕ that a
 * `NSSearchField` shows once it has any is judgement, not a reading: it mirrors the measured
 * magnifier's own inset from the opposite edge and centres on the same line. It is drawn only when
 * there is a query, so every capture-matched state — the empty field — is byte for byte unchanged.
 *
 * **Group rows** (`members`). A group conversation's row draws the same `CKAvatarView` the one-to-one
 * row does (`CKConversationListStandardCell._avatarView`), handed every participant instead of one, and
 * `CNAvatarView` lays those out through `ContactsUICore.SnowglobeUIView` as a stack of circles inside
 * the same Ø40 box — `group-avatar.tsx`'s `snowglobeStack`, which this file used to carry its own copy
 * of. The two were identical to 0.000 across all seven rows on the same 44-unit box, so the merge moved
 * nothing; what the shared component adds is the `UIBlurEffect` plate behind the faces. On a **selected**
 * row that plate is not the generic translucent fill: the material lifts saturation over #3478f6 and a
 * flat overlay cannot, missing by up to 14/255 in blue (light) and 22/255 (dark), so the measured row of
 * `groupAvatarPlate` for that background is passed instead. The preview line is prefixed with
 * `sender`, in the same 12 pt type and the same gray as the rest of the preview: ChatKit does not
 * compose that prefix (`-[CKConversation previewText]` is the message's text alone, and the cell has
 * only a from-label and a summary label), so the wording is the caller's and only the metrics it has to
 * fit are measured.
