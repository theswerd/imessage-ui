 * browserButtonShouldUseMenu]` is YES where `CKUIBehaviorPhone`'s is NO, and
 * `-[CKUIBehaviorMac entryViewSupportsBrowserButton]` is NO. So a row is chosen and a popover opens,
 * which is what these are. Both sizes are Catalyst-probe readings off `CKUIBehaviorMac` in ChatKit
 * 26.5, with the Phone reading beside them so the swap is visible:
 *
 * - `stickerPopoverSize` = **{320, 480}** on the Mac and {393, 680} on the Phone. The iPhone sheet
 *   `sticker-picker.tsx` measures is that 393 wide one, which is why it is not simply re-used at its
 *   own size here.
 * - There is **no** photo-specific popover selector on either behaviour class — the whole
 *   `browser|picker|popover` selector list on `CKUIBehaviorMac` was dumped and it holds none — so the
 *   Photos row takes the generic Mac popover, `popOverWidth` = **252** by `popOverMaxHeight` = **400**.
 *
 * **UNMEASURED, and this is the honest part.** No capture in `references/macos/captures` holds either
 * popover, so only their *sizes* are sourced. Where they sit is a rule, not a reading: they take the
 * "+" menu's own measured leading edge (pane x 9, flush with the button) and open **upward**, their
 * bottom edge on the menu's measured top edge, because neither box fits below the button in a 640 pt
 * window and an AppKit popover flips rather than hangs. The corner is `macPlusMenuMetrics.radius`,
 * the one macOS popover corner a capture does hold; the iPhone sheets' own 40.42 / 60.33 corners are
 * struck off, because those are concentric with the iPhone 17 Pro's 62.9 display corner and mean
 * nothing on a desktop. Everything *inside* each popover is still the iPhone surface's measured
 * layout, re-flowed to the new width by each component's own `width` prop.
 *
 * The **chrome** each box wears is the one macOS popover a capture does hold: the fill, the bright
 * inset rim and the dark hairline outside it that `macos-plus-menu.tsx` measured off
 * `plus-menu-{light,dark}-2x.png`, copied here rather than imported the way that file's own note
 * describes. Each sheet's own iPhone fill is switched off in `macAppStyles` so this one shows: an
