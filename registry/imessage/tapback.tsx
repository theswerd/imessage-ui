/**
 * Tapback balloon, measured from iOS 26 (`references/ios/captures/tapback-love-light.png`, 3x):
 * a Ø34 circle with two trailing circles (Ø10.4 at (−10.82, +15.20) and Ø5 at (−17.49, +23.46) from
 * the balloon's center) pointing away from the bubble. Own reactions are #0088ff (light and dark), the
 * heart is an 18.34×16.33 glossy pink shape centered 0.8 below the circle's center. Others' balloons are
 * #e9e9eb light / #262629 dark (`incoming-light.png`, `incoming-dark.png`). macOS (circle-fitted on
 * `references/macos/captures/tapback-love-light-2x.png` and `tapback-love-dark-2x.png`, both 2x, rmse
 * 0.01–0.03 pt): Ø27.98 centred (136.72, 57.45) pt, trail Ø8.04 at (−9.04, +12.42) and Ø4.00 at
 * (−14.22, +19.05), heart ink 14.64 × 12.96 centred 0.53 below the circle's centre. Both captures give
 * the same numbers to 0.01 pt.
 *
 * The macOS fill is one theme-independent blue, #5498f8, laid over the pane with a vertical opacity
 * ramp: solving the light/dark pair row by row gives a constant colour (85, 152, 248) and an alpha of
 * 0.912 at the top edge rising to 1.00 at ≈83% down (light row y=89 reads (100,161,249), dark
 * (80,141,229); by row y=139 both read (84,152,248)). The trailing circles are fully opaque.
 * The artwork is also knocked out of whatever it covers by a 0.5 pt rim in the pane colour: invisible
 * over the empty pane, it shows as a ring where the balloon laps the bubble (dark 2x, radial cut at
 * −50°: (84,151,247) → (55,88,133) → (84,152,248); light: (85,152,248) → (182,218,251) → (108,186,245)).

/**
 * CSS variables the tapback UI reads (with fallbacks to the light iOS values). Spread on a frame
 * next to `paletteVars`. Glass fills were solved from the captures: the pill over the dimmed white
 * list is #ededef and over the dimmed green bubble ≈#b4efc6 (brighter than the dimmed content, hence
 * the brightness term); over the dimmed black list it is #1f1e21.
 *
 * The dim is one material in both themes at alpha 0.21 over ≈(22, 21.5, 42), and it is measured, not
 * guessed: `longpress-ok-light.png` is `conv3-light.png` with one message pressed, so regressing one
 * capture on the other over the clean rows gives it directly - slope 0.7895/0.8067/0.7889, residual
 * rms 0.17/0.29/0.26 per channel. `conv2-dark.png` -> `longpress-ok-selected-dark.png` returns alpha
 * 0.217/0.210/0.213 over (22.5, 19.1, 42.3), i.e. the same dim. The (22,18,44) this used to carry
 * rendered white as (206,205,210) where every light capture reads (206,206,210).
 *
 * The two themes then carry different green channels (22 light, 21 dark) because no single 8-bit
 * value serves both in Chrome, which quantizes the 0.21 alpha to 54/255 = 0.211765 before
 * compositing. Green 21.5 lands half a level either side of a rounding boundary at both ends of the
 * range: over white it composites to 205.55, and the light captures read 206 (G 22 gives 205.66, G 21
 * gives 205.45); over black it composites to 4.55, and the dark captures read 4 (G 21 gives 4.45,
 * G 22 gives 4.66). R 22 and B 42 clear their boundaries at both ends and need no such split. Over
 * `longpress-ok-light.png` the light nudge takes the frame's interior from -0.9 to -0.1 mean signed
 * green and 1.30 to 1.15 levels of mean absolute error; over `longpress-dark.png` holding dark at 21
 * keeps it at 1.21 rather than 1.46. `messageActionsDim`'s fallback carries the dark value.
 *
 * `--im-menu-glass` was refitted against the captures rather than guessed. Because the tint, the
 * alpha and the brightness term all trade off against each other, only two things are actually
 * determined by a capture: the constant the material contributes, and how much of the backdrop
 * survives it. Both were solved by rendering the menu twice at a fixed alpha and filter, once with a
 * black tint and once with a white one, which makes the output linear in the tint, and then solving
 * for the tint that lands on the capture.
 *
 * The solve runs on the menu's lower 55% only. Above that the menu laps the message it was opened
 * on, and there NO tint at this alpha can reach the capture: at y 610 of `longpress-ok-light.png` the
 * glass reads (181,238,198) over a dimmed bubble the filter turns into ≈(84,238,128), so at alpha 0.8
 * the tint would have to be (-59,218,14). Native carries far more of the bubble's colour through than
 * a flat fill plus `wash` can, and that is a `context-menu.tsx` / `message-actions.tsx` question
 * (the `tint` gradient the menu already supports and the overlay never passes), not a material one.
 * Ours runs +18 R / +12 B over that band and matches to 1-3 levels everywhere below it.
 *
 * The light value was confirmed first, against the old 0.16 shadow: with `longpress-two-line`
 * reconstructing, ok / incoming / two-line solve to (240.0,243.6,243.7), (240.2,240.8,244.0) and
 * (241.2,244.4,244.7), i.e. rgba(241,243,244,0.8) holds and two-line, which used to sit seven levels
 * off, now agrees with the other two. The number in the table below is 4 levels lower than that only
 * because the shadow underneath it changed; see the next paragraph.
 *
 * Both values are then re-solved at the measured shadow, because `context-menu.tsx` paints
 * `menu-shadow` INSIDE the menu, under the glass, so the glass's own backdrop carries it and the
 * tint absorbs whatever it contributes. Taking the shadow from 0.16 to the measured 0.098 lightens
 * that backdrop and drops the solved tint by 4 levels; the slope is 64.5 tint levels per unit of
 * shadow alpha, so a `context-menu.tsx` that masked its own shape out of the shadow (which is what
 * native draws - a drop shadow is not visible under the menu) would want ≈(231,233,234) instead.
 * At 0.098 the three light captures solve to (236.2,239.9,239.9), (236.3,236.9,240.0) and
 * (237.2,240.5,240.7): rgba(237,239,240,0.8), residuals 1.75 / 1.84 / 1.52 levels.
 *
 * Dark is rgba(20,22,23,0.8), fitted the same way now that the dark scenes reconstruct:
 * `longpress-first` -> `longpress-dark.png` (19.4,22.2,22.7), `longpress-last` ->
 * `longpress-last-bubble-dark.png` (20.2,20.5,23.2) and `longpress-selected` ->
 * `longpress-ok-selected-dark.png` (20.4,21.8,23.9), i.e. three captures inside 1.7 levels of each
 * other. It takes the same band from 2.76/2.45/2.43 levels of mean absolute error to 1.61/1.31/1.36.
 * The rgba(20,25,25,0.8) it used to carry was 3 levels green-heavy.
 *
 * `--im-menu-shadow` is the menu's drop shadow, and 0.098 is measured, not the 0.16 the component
 * defaults to. `longpress-ok-light.png` divided by `conv3-light.png` and the dim gives the shadow's
 * alpha directly on every pixel around the menu; fitting a Gaussian to the ring below and beside it
 * returns alpha 0.0992, sigma 17.52 pt, offset 7.00 pt down (rms 0.0025 alpha), and
 * `longpress-incoming-light.png` over `incoming-light.png` returns 0.0971 / 17.18 / 7.00. It is a
 * pure black shadow: the three channels' alphas agree to 0.001. NOTE for `context-menu.tsx`: its
 * `blur(11px)` is a sigma of 11 and needs to be 17.4 for the falloff to match - the shadow reaches
 * 41 pt below the menu in the capture and 28 in ours. The alpha is right either way (fitting it at
 * the wrong sigma returns 0.1012), so this value stands on its own.
 *
 * The dark theme's shadow is UNVERIFIED: every dark capture puts the menu over a near-black ground,
 * where a black shadow at any alpha is invisible. It carries the light value rather than the
 * component's unmeasured 0.16.

 * dissolve (95%→5% in 134 ms). The balloon then appears at f118 = 1967 ms, 100 ms after the menu is
 * gone, in the same frame the list starts opening the slot. Its fill diameter over the settled Ø28
 * measures 0.19 (f118), 0.28 (f119), ≈0.52 (f120), ≈0.65 (f121), ≈0.75 (f122) and ≥0.80 (f123), so it
 * needs ≈110 ms to reach full size counting from the last empty frame. The small trailing circle
 * measures 0.49 / 0.64 / 0.71 / 0.81 across f120–f123, i.e. it rides the balloon's own scale with no
 * delay of its own — hence `trailDelay: 0` and no separate animation for the trail.
 *
 * The strip ends at f123 = 2050 ms with the balloon still growing, so the overshoot past 1 and the
