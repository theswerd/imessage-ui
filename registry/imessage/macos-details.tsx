/**
 * macOS 26 conversation details: the inspector column on the trailing edge of the Messages window.
 *
 * ### The source
 *
 * **This file is now fitted to a capture.** `references/macos/details-pane.md` records every number
 * below and describes the source: a private screenshot of the user's own macOS 26 Messages, 960 × 640
 * pt, `Conversation ▸ Show Details` open on a group. The capture is **not in this repo and must not
 * be** — it is a real conversation with real people in it. Nothing from it beyond geometry and flat
 * colour has been copied anywhere.
 *
 * Two things about that capture bound every number here, and both are recorded in the reference:
 *
 * 1. **It survives only as a 1x, 960 × 640 downscale of the 2x original.** So 1 px = 1 pt and no
 *    reading is finer than about ±0.5 pt. Sizes below are the fitted integers; the raw pixel spans
 *    are in the reference.
 * 2. **It is dark only, and its pane is a translucent material** that samples the desktop behind the
 *    window: the fill drifts from #1c1f23 at the divider to #1b1b1b at the window edge, following the
 *    wallpaper. `--mdt-panel` is the median of that drift, and it is a flat stand-in for a material
 *    this kit cannot reproduce. **Every light value in `vars` is derived, not captured** — there is
 *    no light capture of this pane anywhere — and each one says where it came from.
 *
 * ### What the capture overturned
 *
 * The previous version of this file had no capture and built the pane out of `CKUIBehaviorMac`
 * selectors plus SPEC's measurement of the *sidebar*. Four of its structural choices are wrong:
 *
 * | It drew | The capture shows |
 * |---|---|
 * | a floating panel inset 8 with a 22 pt continuous corner and a drop shadow | a **flush column**, x 660–959, square, no shadow, with a **1 pt divider** on its leading edge at x 660 |
 * | the transcript squeezed and the sidebar left alone | the **sidebar collapsed** — the transcript runs from x 0 — and the transcript keeps its full width beside the column |
 * | Ø 37 contact photo, Ø 72 group pancake, name 13 bold | **one Ø 60 circle**, centred, name **23 bold** under it |
 * | Ø 32 quick actions 12 apart, one `info.circle` in the top-right | **Ø 36 discs 16 apart**, and a top-left Ø 36 close button with an **"Edit"** capsule opposite |
 *
 * The tab strip is real and reads **Info · Backgrounds · Photos · Links · Location**, it scrolls, and
 * it bleeds to the pane's trailing edge. The Info tab's body is a **Find My map card**, then a card of
 * location actions in destructive red and accent yellow, then a **row of Ø 70 participant faces** with
 * an Add button.
 *
 * ### What is still framework, not capture
 *
 * The capture shows one tab of one conversation, unscrolled. Everything under the participant row —
 * the contact handles, the photo/link/document previews, the Hide Alerts / Send Read Receipts / Shared
 * With You checkboxes, Leave / Block / Delete — is below the fold in it, so its **order and metrics are
 * unchanged from the framework reading** and are collected in `macDetailsUnmeasured` and the tables
 * below. Those readings came from a `clang -target arm64-apple-ios26.0-macabi` probe that dlopens
 * ChatKit and `CommunicationDetails`, swizzles `-[UIDevice userInterfaceIdiom]` to 5 so
 * `+[CKUIBehavior sharedBehaviors]` vends `CKUIBehaviorMac`, and reads:
 *
 * | Value | Selector |
 * |---|---|
 * | column 300 wide, resizable 280–400 | `defaultInspectorColumnWidth`, `min…`, `max…` — **300 is now also measured** |
 * | content inset 16 | `searchDetailsLeadingAndTrailingMaxPadding` — **also measured** |
 * | map 196 tall | `detailsViewMapHeight` — **also measured (197 ± 1)** |
 * | photo grid gap 10, tile radius 8 | `searchPhotosInterItemSpacingDetailsView`, `searchPhotosCellZKWAndDetailsCornerRadius` |
 * | link / document row radius 8, row height 40, option row 44 | `searchLinksCellCornerRadius`, `detailsContactCellMinimumHeight`, `+[CKDetailsChatOptionsCell estimatedHeight]` |
 * | 16 × 16 checkboxes | `CKDetailsChatOptionsCheckboxCell`; a Mac-idiom `UISwitch` reports style 1, 16 × 16 |
 * | section heading 13 Regular | `searchDetailsHeaderFont` |
 *
 * Three of those — 300, 16 and 196 — the capture independently reproduces, which is the cross-check
 * that the probe was reading genuine Mac values.
 *
 * ### Glyphs
 *
 * `detailsViewPhoneImage` / `detailsViewFaceTimeVideoImage` / `detailsViewMessagesImage` are
 * `phone.fill`, `video.fill` and `message.fill`, and a point-size sweep pins all three to 17 pt
 * (17 pt is the only size where their ink boxes are simultaneously {15.5, 15.5}, {20.5, 13.5} and
 * {19.5, 16}). Each path below is traced off a 16x render on the alpha-0.5 isoline, and each `viewBox`
 * *is* the ink box. The capture measures the painted ink at **14 × 14 (phone)** and **17 × 12 (video,
 * envelope)** inside the Ø 36 disc, i.e. the framework's 17 pt art scaled to ≈ 0.83, so
 * `macDetailsMetrics.actionGlyph` scales them rather than redrawing them.
 *
 * ### The presentation is still UNMEASURED
 *
 * Nothing records this pane in motion and no `*duration*` selector on `CKUIBehaviorMac` is inspector-
 * or details-named. `macDetailsMotion` is a choice, not a reading.
 *
 * Copy is `ChatKit.loctable` / `CommunicationDetails.loctable` verbatim: "Info" (`CONTACT_INFO_SHORT`),
 * "Photos", "Links", "Documents" (`SEARCH_ATTACHMENTS_TITLE`), "Hide Alerts", "Send Read Receipts",
 * "Shared With You", "Create New Contact", "Add to Existing Contact", "Block Contact", "Delete
 * Conversation…", "Leave this Conversation", "Call" / "FaceTime" / "Mail" / "Message". "Backgrounds",
 * "Location", "Edit" and "Add" are read off the capture.

 * | `--mdt-panel` | **#1b1c1d**, the median of a material that drifts #1c1f23 → #1b1b1b across the column | SPEC's measured light sidebar panel |
 * | `--mdt-ground` | **#1e1e1e**, the transcript beside it | `_transcriptBackgroundColor` light |
 * | `--mdt-divider` | **#34383c** — the hairline reads #353b41 over a material reading #1c1e21, so +25/+28/+31 on the flat panel | SPEC's measured light row separator |
 * | `--mdt-fill` | **#37383c**, shared by the action discs, both cards and the Add circle | the same delta inverted |
 * | `--mdt-tab-fill` | **#3e3f42**, the selected tab capsule | a raised white capsule, as macOS segmented controls are |
 * | `--mdt-glass` / `--mdt-glass-rim` | **#191c1d** inside a 1 pt **#2e3033** rim — the header buttons are *darker* than the pane | inverted |
 * | `--mdt-separator` | **#4e5055**, inside the action card | SPEC's light row separator |
 * | `--mdt-red` | **#ff5b65**. Note this is **not** `systemRed` dark (#ff453a); the capture is measurably lighter and the same method recovers `systemYellow` exactly, so the reading stands | `systemRed` light |
 * | `--mdt-yellow` | **#ffd600** = `systemYellow` dark | `systemYellow` light |
 * | `--mdt-label` | white; a 23 px stem reads 227/255, which is `labelColor` dark (white at 85%) over this ground | `labelColor` light |
 * | `--mdt-secondary` | white at 68%: the unselected tab peaks at #a8a9aa on a 1x downscale, which under-reads a thin stroke, so this is a floor, not an equality | `CKUIThemeMac` |
