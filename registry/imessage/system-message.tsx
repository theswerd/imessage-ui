/**
 * The centred grey transcript lines that are not bubbles: a group rename, a join, a leave, the group
 * photo and background, an unsent message, a kept attachment, a failed group edit, and the
 * unknown-sender notice.
 *
 * ## Where every number comes from
 *
 * Two sources, and the code says which for each value. Nothing here is a guess except the four
 * things called out under "Still unmeasured".
 *
 * ### 1. `references/ios/captures/incoming-light.png` (402x874 @3x), the unknown-sender notice
 *
 * The only frame in this repo that holds any member of this family. Re-measured for this file with a
 * full-width non-white row scan (`scripts/measure/px.py row` agrees; the scan is reproduced by
 * `/lab/system-message?scene=notice`):
 *
 * - Line 1 ("If you did not expect this message from an unknown sender, it may") inks device rows
 *   2163-2195; line 2 ("be spam.") inks 2204-2234. Row 2203 is clear, so line 2 starts at 2204.
 * - **Line pitch 13.3333**, read twice and independently. Baselines: line 1's inked-pixel count
 *   falls 525 -> 128 between rows 2188 and 2189, line 2's falls 82 -> 24 between 2228 and 2229, so
 *   the baselines are 40 device rows apart. The x-height band opens on row 2170 (n jumps 65 -> 337)
 *   and on row 2210 (n jumps 5 -> 41): also 40 rows. 40/3 = 13.3333.
 * - **Font size 11**, established by *width*, not by x-height. Line 1's ink spans device x 67-1137,
 *   i.e. 22.3333 to 379.3333 = 357.0 pt of advance for 65 characters. 12 pt would need ~389 and
 *   would not fit the 370 column at all. (The x-height argument that used to live here proves
 *   nothing: ChatKit reports `-[UIFont xHeight]` = 5.79 for this font, and a threshold scan of the
 *   capture reads 6.33, so every x-height reading in this repo is anti-aliasing-inflated.)
 * - **Colour #8a8a8e light / #8d8d93 dark**, which is `--im-secondary`. Confirmed from both ends:
 *   the capture's darkest ink is exactly (138,138,142), and ChatKit's transcript attributes carry
 *   `UIColor.secondaryLabel`, which on iOS is (60,60,67, 0.6) -> (138,138,142.2) over white and
 *   (235,235,245, 0.6) -> (141,141,147) over black.
 * - **The 370 column** (402 - 2 x 16): it reproduces the capture's line break to the word.
 * - **Space above: 16.1667.** The bubble body above ends at 702.67 (`ios-notices.tsx`). Line 1's
 *   baseline is at 729.6667; walking back the 10.6348 ascent and the 0.1891 half-leading of a
 *   13.3333 box puts the line box top at 718.84, i.e. 16.1667 below the bubble. This file splits
 *   that the way ChatKit does: `padTop` 3 belongs to the item, `gapAbove` 13.1667 to the layout.
 *
 * ### 2. ChatKit 26.5, read with a Catalyst probe
 *
 * `clang -target arm64-apple-ios26.0-macabi`, `dlopen`
 * `/System/iOSSupport/.../ChatKit.framework/ChatKit`, `-[UIDevice userInterfaceIdiom]` swizzled to
 * `.phone` and to `.mac`, and `CKUIBehaviorPhone` / `CKUIBehaviorMac` instantiated directly. Every
 * reading below was taken in this session, not quoted:
 *
 * | reading | phone | mac |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `transcriptRegularFontAttributes` | .SFNS-Regular **11**, natural line height 13.0, centred, no min/max line height, no line spacing | identical |
 * | `transcriptEmphasizedFontAttributes` | .SFNS-**Medium**, `UIFontWeightTrait` 0.23 = `UIFontWeightMedium` = CSS **500** | identical |
 * | `transcriptGroupModificationErrorRegularFontAttributes` | .SFNS-**Light**, trait -0.4 = CSS **300**, `systemRedColor` | identical |
 * | `transcriptGroupModificationErrorEmphasizedFontAttributes` | .SFNS-Medium 11, `systemRedColor` | identical |
 * | `-[CKGroupActionChatItem textAlignmentInsets]` | top **3**, bottom **3** | top **2.5**, bottom **2** |
 * | `-[CKGroupActionChatItem hasSelectableText]` | **NO** | **NO** |
 * | `transcriptMessageStatusFont` ("Delivered") | .SFNS-Semibold 11 | .SFNS-Medium 9 |
 * | `transcriptStatusItemEdgeInsets` | all zeros | all zeros |
 *
 * Three consequences, each of which was wrong here before:
 *
 * - The emphasised run is weight **500**, not 600. The old 600 was borrowed from
 *   `transcriptMessageStatusFont`, which is the "Delivered" label - a different font from the
 *   emphasis run inside a status sentence.
 * - **macOS is 11/13, the same as iOS**, not 9/11. `transcriptMessageStatusFont` is the one
 *   transcript metric ChatKit scales per idiom, and it is precisely the one this file used to
 *   borrow. The transcript status text does not scale.
 * - `hasSelectableText` is NO, so `select-none` is a reading, not a preference.
 *
 * ### 3. The strings
 *
 * Every sentence below is a ChatKit format string, verbatim, from
 * `.../ChatKit.framework/Resources/ChatKit.loctable` (`plistlib`, no probe needed). They are kept as
 * templates in `statusTemplates` rather than assembled in code, so the wording cannot drift. ChatKit
 * marks the emphasised run with `#...#`; that this is emphasis markup and not a substitution token
 * is settled by the localisations, where the delimiters wrap a translated verb phrase:
 * `es` "#Has denominado# la conversación “%@”.", `de` "#Du# hast...", `ja` "#あなた#が...".
 *
 * That markup fixes two more errors this file used to make: **"You" is emphasised** (every
 * `GROUP_YOU_*` string wraps it), and **the added or removed participant is not** - only the actor
 * sits inside `#...#`, so "**You** added Sam Rivera to the conversation." bolds the first half, not
 * the second.
 *
 * ### What this surface is not
 *
 * - **A missed call is not a Messages transcript line.** ChatKit's string tables contain no `Missed*`
 *   string of any kind; "Missed Call" and "Missed FaceTime" live in FaceTime.app's `Recents.loctable`
 *   (the recents list), and "Missed Video Call" - which this file used to render - exists nowhere on
 *   the system. A call in a transcript is the FaceTime card: use `facetime-card.tsx` with
 *   `state="missed"`.
 * - **A tapback is not a transcript line either**, it is a balloon (`tapback.tsx`). The six verbs are
 *   real, but they come from `IMSharedUtilities.loctable` ("%@ loved “%@”", "You loved “%@”"), which
 *   is the *notification and sidebar preview* format: it carries no `#...#` emphasis at all, and
 *   ChatKit has no status string for a reaction. `tapbackSummary()` below renders that preview
 *   string; it is deliberately not a `SystemMessageEvent`.
 *
 * ### Still unmeasured
 *
 * 1. **`gapAbove` / `gapBelow` for the group lines on both platforms.** ChatKit keeps the item's own
 *    padding in `textAlignmentInsets` (which we have) but the spacing *between* chat items in
 *    `-[CKChatItem layoutItemSpacingWithEnvironment:...]`, which needs a live collection-view layout
 *    environment; `transcriptStatusItemEdgeInsets` is all zeros. No committed capture shows a group
 *    conversation on either platform. The remaining route is an iOS-simulator capture of a real group
 *    event: seed the booted simulator's `Library/SMS/sms.db` with `item_type` 1/2/3/6 rows and
 *    screenshot with `xcrun simctl io booted screenshot`. That was attempted for this file and the
 *    sandbox declined the write to the Messages database, so it needs an explicit permission grant.
 * 2. **The space *below* a status line is not a number this file owns.** ChatKit's layout puts one
 *    spacing between two chat items, so the space below a status line is the next row's space above.
 *    That is also why there is no `gapBelow` in the metrics: see `SystemMessageMetrics.gapAbove`.
 *    Nothing sits under the notice in the capture anyway, except its own "Report Spam" pill 10.33
 *    below, which belongs to `UnknownSenderNotice`.
 * 3. **`macos.letterSpacing`.** No macOS capture holds any line of this family, so there is no
 *    advance to fit. 0 is the untracked default, like `date-separator.tsx`'s macOS line.
 * 4. **`errorColor.ios`.** `systemRedColor` is a `UIDynamicCatalogSystemColor`: the Catalyst probe
 *    resolves it on the host, so it returned the *macOS* red (#ff383c / #ff4245) under both idioms.
 *    The iOS pair below is Apple's published iOS systemRed and is not a reading.
 *
 * ### Motion
 *
 * **UNVERIFIED**, and marked so on `systemMessageMotion`. Nothing in `references/` captures a status
 * line arriving. It is built the way the rest of the kit builds unverified motion: one Web Animations
 * animation on the row, so `document.getAnimations()` reaches it and `animateIn={{ progress }}`
 * pauses and seeks it instead of playing it. Reduced motion drops the rise and keeps the fade.
