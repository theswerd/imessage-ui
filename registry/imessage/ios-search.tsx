/**
 * iOS 26 Messages search: what the conversation list becomes when the search field takes focus, and
 * the result sections that fill the screen once there is a query.
 *
 * ## Where the numbers come from
 *
 * **Measured from a capture.** Two captures of this screen were taken on 2026-09-08 on the same
 * iPhone 17 Pro / iOS 26.0 simulator as the rest of `references/ios/captures`, by pressing **⌘F** in
 * Messages with a hardware keyboard attached (no pointer events; the state cannot be reached any
 * other way from a script):
 *
 * - `references/ios/captures/search-active-light.png` - focused, empty query, light.
 * - `references/ios/captures/search-noresults-dark.png` - query "Detail", no matches, dark.
 *
 * They settle the layout, and they overturn what this file used to draw:
 *
 * - **The field does not move.** Diffing `search-active-light.png` against `list-light.png` over the
 *   bottom bar returns a difference box that starts at x 224 px (the caret) - every pixel of the pill
 *   left of it, the magnifier, the placeholder, the mic, the pill's shadow and the 12pt gap to the
 *   circle beside it are byte-identical. The pill stays 286 wide at x 28-314, y 798-846. There is no
 *   rise to the top of the screen, no widening, and **no Cancel button**.
 * - **The compose circle becomes a close button** in place: the same Ø48 glass circle centred
 *   (350, 822), now holding an ✕ whose ink box is exactly 17.0 x 17.0 centred (349.833, 822.5) with a
 *   ~2.0pt diagonal stroke in the compose glyph's own ink colour.
 * - **The conversation list is simply replaced**, with no dim: every pixel above the bar in
 *   `search-active-light.png` is the page background (`searchControllerObscuresConversationList` is
 *   YES on the Phone behaviour). The 20% black scrim this file used to paint does not exist.
 * - **The caret** is 2.0 x 22.0 at x 74.667, y 811-833 (centre 822.0) in the measured link blue, drawn
 *   over the placeholder's leading edge; the placeholder itself does not move or fade.
 * - **The mic survives focus** and is swapped for a Ø17.0 clear disc only once there is text. The disc
 *   is centred (284.5, 821.833) - the mic ink's own centre to within 0.17 - filled with the
 *   placeholder colour, with a knocked-out ✕ whose ink box is 7.2pt across and ~1.65pt thick.
 * - **Typed text** starts at the placeholder's own origin and is the placeholder's weight (both stems
 *   measure 5 device px at 3x), in the label colour, not a lighter one.
 * - **Nothing is shown before a query.** `search-active-light.png` is blank above the bar, so the
 *   default empty state really is nothing.
 * - **"No Results"** is UIKit's search content-unavailable view, not a ChatKit one: a magnifier whose
 *   ink is 45.33 x 46.0 at y 375.67-421.67, "No Results" (cap top 445.33, cap height 16.0, ink
 *   107.67 wide) and "Check the spelling or try a new search." (ink 473.0-486.33, 263.0 wide), all
 *   centred on x 201. The block's ink centre is y 431.0 and the results area runs 62 to 798, whose
 *   centre is 430.0 - so the block is centred in the results area, which is also what pins
 *   `resultsTop` and the results area's bottom edge. Only the title string is ChatKit's
 *   (`SEARCH_RESULTS_INDEXING_TITLE`); the subtitle is not in `ChatKit.loctable` at all.
 *
 * Everything the field and the rows share with the conversation list is still the conversation list's
 * measurement (`list-light.png` / `list-dark.png`, SPEC.md "Conversation list"): the 48pt pill inset
 * 28 with radius 24, the magnifier, the 86.6667 row, the Ø45 avatar at x 26, the 17pt semibold name at
 * x 83, the 15pt time, the chevron at 376, the 15/20 preview, the separator from x 83 to 386, the
 * glass fills and shadows, and the #0088ff / #0091ff tint.
 *
 * **Measured motion** (`references/ios/motion/search-open.mov`, `search-close.mov`, recorded with
 * `simctl io recordVideo`; the simulator writes a frame only when the screen changes, so every frame
 * carries its own timestamp). Both were traced by summing the blue channel excess of the two avatars
 * over a fixed column, which is proportional to the list's alpha, and by following the avatars' ink
 * box, which gives their translation:
 *
 * - **Opening takes 267 ms.** The list fades out where it stands and slides *up*; its diameter never
 *   changes, so there is no scale. Alpha runs 1.000, 0.973, 0.955, 0.904, 0.844, 0.773, 0.681, 0.586,
 *   0.488, 0.401, 0.312, 0.230, 0.155, 0.103, 0.053, 0.034, 0.000 on an even 16.7 ms grid - a
 *   symmetric S, half gone at 131 ms. The translation accelerates: 0, 2.00, 5.17, 9.33, 15.33, 22.67,
 *   31.33, 40.67, 51.33, 61.33, 71.00 pt at the same times, still accelerating when the list gets too
 *   faint to follow at 172 ms. The bar does not move at all; only the trailing circle's glyph changes.
 * - **Closing takes 292 ms and is not the opening reversed.** The search surface is gone inside one
 *   recorded frame (under 3.3 ms) and the list appears at alpha 0.858, 106.67 pt high, then settles:
 *   translation 0, 0.031, 0.119, 0.275, 0.431, 0.619, 0.794, 0.913, 0.988, 1.000 of the travel and
 *   alpha 0.858 -> 1.000, both ease-in-out over the same 292 ms.
 *
 * Both curves are carried as keyframe tables (`iosSearchMotion`) rather than as an easing name,
 * because they are samples, not a fitted curve. The list is a sibling component this file does not
 * own, so the surface reproduces the measured *visibility* by painting the page colour at
 * `1 - listAlpha` (the composite over the same background colour is the same pixels), and the
 * translation is applied only when the caller hands over the list's scrolling layer as `listRef`.
 *
 * **Read out of the framework.** No capture of a search *result* exists and none can be taken: the
 * simulator's two conversations hold no messages and its Spotlight index is empty, so every query
 * returns "No Results". The sections are therefore built from ChatKit 26.5, read at runtime off
 * `[[CKUIBehaviorPhone alloc] init]` in a Mac Catalyst probe that dlopens
 * `/System/iOSSupport/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ChatKit.framework/ChatKit`. Each value names
 * its selector on the constant it feeds. Section titles, "See All" and "No Results" are the
 * framework's own English strings from `ChatKit.loctable`.
 *
 * Three structural facts also come from the runtime rather than guesswork:
 *
 * - `+[CKConversationSearchResultCell conversationListCellClass]` returns
 *   `CKConversationSearchResultEmbeddedCell`, a `CKConversationListStandardCell` subclass, and
 *   `-[CKUIBehavior searchMessageCellHeightForDisplayScale:]` returns 86.66667 at scale 3, 86.5 at 2
 *   and 87 at 1 - the conversation list's own row pitch. **Careful:** that selector branches on the
 *   live `UIDevice` idiom, not on the behaviour class, so a probe that applies the documented `.mac`
 *   swizzle gets 84.0 at every scale. Unswizzled (Catalyst reports the phone idiom) it gives the
 *   iPhone numbers above, which are the ones this file uses.
 * - `-[CKMessageSearchResultCell _annotatedResultStringForResult:searchText:]` passes
 *   `searchMessagesBalloonFont` as **both** the primary and the annotated font and only swaps the
 *   colour, so a message match is recoloured, never bolded. Its pre-trim,
 *   `ck_trimmedStringWithPreferredLength:anchoredAroundSubstring:` at 200 characters, is
 *   `trimAroundMatch` below. That pre-trim alone leaves the match off the end of a one-line balloon,
 *   so the balloon additionally anchors its *visible* window on the match - see `Snippet`.
 * - `CKLinkSearchResultCell` holds an `LPLinkView` and an `LPLinkMetadata`, so a link result is a
 *   LinkPresentation card, not a thumbnail with two captions under it.
 *
 * **Judgement, not measured.** Called out again on each constant: how the framework's own spacings
 * compose into a section (which constant is the gap under a header and which is the gap under a
 * section); that Photos, Links and Documents lay out as horizontal strips; that
 * `searchCellPreferredWidth` is the strip cell's width; that results scroll under the floating bar;
 * and the clear button's cross arm length. Do not quote any of those as measured.
