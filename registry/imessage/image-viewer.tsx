/**
 * The full-screen photo viewer: what a photo in a bubble opens into.
 *
 * THIS SURFACE IS NOW CAPTURED. Messages does not draw a photo browser of its own — it presents
 * QuickLook, and `ChatKit.CKQLPreviewController` is the `QLPreviewController` subclass it presents.
 * That subclass can be instantiated outside Messages, so the screen was reproduced and shot:
 *
 *   1. A throwaway iOS app (`clang -target arm64-apple-ios18.0-simulator`) with a `QLPreviewItem`
 *      data source over five generated JPEGs, installed on a private iPhone 17 Pro / iOS 26.0
 *      (23A343) simulator with `xcrun simctl install`.
 *   2. `dlopen("/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ChatKit.framework/ChatKit")` inside that app,
 *      `objc_getClass("CKQLPreviewController")`, present it full screen.
 *   3. `xcrun simctl io <udid> screenshot` at 402x874 @3x, and a walk of the live view hierarchy
 *      logging every frame in window coordinates — so the bar geometry is read off the runtime, not
 *      guessed from pixels, and the screenshot only confirms it.
 *
 * Captures: `references/ios/captures/image-viewer-chrome-dark.png` (chrome up over the black ground)
 * and `image-viewer-fit-dark.png` (a 3:4 photo fitted, chrome auto-hidden). Written up in
 * `references/image-viewer.md` and `references/SPEC.md`.
 *
 * WHAT THE CAPTURE OVERTURNED. The chrome is not two opaque bars with a scrim and a centred title.
 * On iOS 26 it is three Liquid Glass circles floating over the photo: a close X top right, and a
 * bottom row of reply (left) and share (right). There is no "Done" text button, no title text and no
 * thumbnail tray. `-[CKQLPreviewController updateBarButtonItems]` disassembles to a single `ret`, so
 * ChatKit builds no bars at all: `loadView` only sets `navigationBar.barStyle`, and QuickLook lays
 * the buttons out itself (`-tapbackButtonFrameForFullScreenBalloonViewController:` forwards to
 * `-frameForAdditionalButtonWithActionName:`, QuickLook's own additional-button slot).
 *
 * FRAMEWORK values are read out of the binaries on this Mac (macOS 26.5.2, Messages 26.0) from a
 * macCatalyst process that dlopens the iOSSupport frameworks. `PUOneUpSettings` is idiom-dependent
 * and its singleton latches the idiom at first `+sharedInstance`, so every read below was taken in a
 * fresh process with `-[UIDevice userInterfaceIdiom]` swizzled to 0 (phone) BEFORE the first access.
 * That is the difference between `interpageSpacing` 40 (phone and mac) and 100 (pad); a plain
 * Catalyst process reports pad. Method bodies come from `lldb ... -o "disassemble -n '-[Class sel]'"`
 * against the loaded image, because the on-disk binaries are shared-cache stubs.
 *
 * The accessible names are ChatKit's own, from
 * `AccessibilityBundles/ChatKitFramework.axbundle/Contents/Resources/Accessibility.loctable`:
 * `photo.attachment` = "Photo", `messages.attachment.stack.view.format` = "attachment %1$d of %2$d",
 * `save.photo.button` = "Save photo", `balloon.message.reply` = "Reply". The live bar buttons carry
 * `accessibilityLabel` "close", "reply" and "Share".
 *
 * JUDGEMENT, with no framework symbol and no capture behind it — each one says so again where it
 * lives, and they are listed in SPEC's "what is not measured": the thresholds that commit a swipe or
 * a dismissal, the scale the photo shrinks to while it is being flung away, where an applied tapback
 * balloon sits on a full-screen photo, the save and tapback buttons' glyphs and their slot in the
 * bar, and the whole macOS presentation.
 *
 * SEEKABLE. The entrance and the exit are one Web Animations timeline per layer, so
 * `document.getAnimations()` reaches them and `progress` pauses and seeks instead of playing. With
 * `progress` set, every CSS transition in the tree is switched off and the chrome's auto-hide timer
 * never arms, so a checkpoint renders the same frame every run.

 * always takes the bottom-tail branch — but it takes it because the geometry says so, not because
