/**
 * The two avatar surfaces a group conversation has and a one-to-one does not: the stacked group
 * photo, and the small per-sender photo beside an incoming bubble.
 *
 * ## Where the numbers come from
 *
 * **A capture now exists.** Nothing in `references/ios/captures` or `references/macos/captures` shows
 * a group conversation — `grouped-light.png` is message *grouping* in a two-person thread and
 * `details-light.png` is a one-to-one details screen. So this surface was captured on purpose:
 * `references/group-avatar/snowglobe-light.png` and `snowglobe-dark.png` are
 * `xcrun simctl io booted screenshot` of the iPhone 17 Pro simulator (1206x2622 = 402x874 pt at 3x,
 * the repo's iOS capture geometry) running a small app that dlopens the runtime's own
 * ChatKit/ContactsUICore and lays out real `CKAvatarView`s over `CNMutableContact` fixtures. Every
 * circle in those two PNGs is drawn by Apple's code, in a live window, with a live blur. See
 * `references/group-avatar.md` for the layout and how to re-take them.
 *
 * The frames and diameters below are read straight out of the frameworks with a Mac Catalyst probe
 * (`clang -target arm64-apple-ios26.0-macabi`, `-[UIDevice userInterfaceIdiom]` swizzled to the idiom
 * being asked about, then `dlopen`), and cross-checked against those captures.
 *
 * ## The stack
 *
 * A group photo is not a ChatKit drawing at all: `CKAvatarView` is a `CNAvatarView` subclass, and
 * ContactsUICore lays the faces out through
 * `+[CNUIAvatarLayoutManager layoutConfigurationsForType:withItemCount:]`. Type 2 is
 * `SnowglobeAvatarLayoutConfigurations`, the one a group photo uses; type 3 is
 * `SnowglobeGroupTypingIndicatorAvatarLayoutConfigurations`, the same circles in a different order.
 * Each entry is a `CNUIAvatarLayoutItemConfiguration` carrying `x`, `y`, `size` and `baseSize`, and
 * `-itemFrameInContainingBounds:isRTL:` turns one into a frame:
 *
 * ```
 * s = bounds.width / baseSize          baseSize is 88 for every Snowglobe entry
 * d = size * s
 * frame = (bounds.midX + x*s - d/2, bounds.midY + y*s - d/2, d, d)
 * ```
 *
 * `snowglobeStack` is that table verbatim. One participant fills the circle; two and three have their
 * own rows; four, five and six add a slot to the three-face row; seven re-lays the whole set.
 * `+[CNUIAvatarLayoutManager maxAvatarCountForType:]` answers 10, but asking for 8, 9, 10 or 11
 * returns the same seven entries, so an eighth participant is simply not drawn.
 *
 * **The faces never touch.** The previous version of this file claimed "there is no ring, cut-out or
 * hairline between the faces — they simply overlap". They do not overlap: the table leaves a gap, and
 * that gap *is* the ring you see. Minimum centre-to-centre clearance, computed from the table and
 * confirmed in the capture (`snowglobeClearance`, in base-88 units): 1.598 for two faces, 2.446 for
 * three, 2.040 for four through six, 2.071 for seven — 1.09 / 1.67 / 1.39 / 1.41 pt once scaled to
 * Ø60. Whatever is behind the stack shows through that gap, and nothing strokes it.
 *
 * **The largest face is at the back, not the front.** A live `CKAvatarView` builds a
 * `ContactsUICore.SnowglobeUIView` holding one `ContactsUICore.AvatarUIView` per person, added in
 * table order with `zPosition` 0 on every one — so the first (largest) entry is the first subview and
 * paints first. (`-[CNUIAvatarLayoutItemConfiguration updateLayer:inBounds:atIndex:isRTL:layoutType:]`
 * does set `zPosition` to `-index`, but that path is not the one a group photo runs.) The previous
 * version asserted the opposite; it never showed because the faces do not overlap. This component
 * paints in table order with no `z-index`, which is the native order.
 *
 * **The frosted plate is real, and it is a circle.** `SnowglobeUIView` inserts a `UIVisualEffectView`
 * as subview 0, filling the box, behind every face, with `UIBlurEffect material=20` —
 * `.systemThinMaterial` (`+[UIBlurEffect effectWithStyle:]` reports material 20 for
 * `systemThinMaterial` and its Light/Dark siblings). The view's frame is square, but it is masked to a
 * circle: traced in `snowglobe-light.png` with `scripts/measure/outline.py` the plate is 60.00 x 60.00
 * pt with a ~29.5 pt radius on all four corners, i.e. a full-box disc. It is present only for two or
 * more faces — one contact skips `SnowglobeUIView` entirely and gets a bare `AvatarUIView`.
 * `groupAvatarPlate` is the material measured over five backgrounds in both appearances.
 *
 * **RTL** mirrors x about the centre and nothing else, so the whole stack is expressible as
 * `inset-inline-start`: a face at physical `left` L in a box of S with diameter d lands at `S - L - d`
 * in RTL, which is exactly what `inset-inline-start: L` does. This component therefore inherits the
 * document direction for free; `rtl` only stamps `dir` when a caller forces it.
 *
 * ## Sizes, per behaviour object
 *
 * `-[CKUIBehavior* groupAvatarViewSize]` is 60 x 60 on Phone, Pad and Mac alike — the nav-bar avatar's
 * Ø60 in `conv3-light.png`. The list rows are a different constant:
 * `conversationListContactImageDiameter` is 45 on Phone and Pad (SPEC's Ø45 iOS list rows) and 40 on
 * Mac (SPEC's Ø40 sidebar rows and Ø40 header avatar). See `groupAvatarMetrics`.
 *
 * The iOS **details** header is not this stack. `CKDetailsAvatarPancakeView` — diameter 37, cut-out
 * 41, overlap 13.5, widths 58 and 72 for two and three, all still on the behaviour object as
 * `detailsAvatar*` / `detailsAvatarPancakeView*` — is a row of overlapping heads with knockouts, and
 * `group-details.tsx` already draws it. (`registry.json` says this component covers "the details
 * header"; it does not, and that line wants correcting.)
 *
 * ## The per-sender avatar
 *
 * `+[CKChatItemLayoutUtilities avatarSupplementaryItemForChatItem:layoutEnvironment:]` returns an
 * `NSCollectionLayoutSupplementaryItem` of `.absolute(d) x .absolute(d)` at `zIndex` 1, anchored with
 * `[NSCollectionLayoutAnchor layoutAnchorWithEdges:6 absoluteOffset:(-d, 0)]`. Edges 6 is
 * `NSDirectionalRectEdge.leading | .bottom`, so the avatar hangs off the balloon's leading edge with
 * its **bottom flush to the balloon's bottom** — which is why a cluster carries one avatar, on its
 * last (tailed) bubble. `d` is not hardcoded: running the same call under each idiom returns 32 / 34 /
 * 28, i.e. `-[CKUIBehavior* transcriptContactImageDiameter]`, and
 * `-[CKTranscriptAvatarSupplementaryView initWithFrame:]` builds its `CKAvatarView` at exactly
 * `(0, 0, d, d)` with no inset whatever frame the view is given. `contactPhotoBalloonMargin` is 7 on
 * all three; the leading gutter an incoming row gives up is `d + 7` = **39 / 41 / 35**.
 *
 * The group typing indicator uses a bigger face: `transcriptGroupTypingContactImageDiameter`, 44 / 48
 * / 42. `typing-indicator.tsx` does not draw one yet; the constant is here so it can.
 *
 * ## Motion
 *
 * When a new message joins an incoming cluster the avatar hands off to the new last bubble, riding the
 * transcript's insert animation: `-[CKUIBehavior* scrollInNewMessageAnimationDuration]` is **0.300 s**
 * on all three idioms. `SenderAvatar` plays that as a FLIP on the Web Animations API so the harness can
 * seek it with `progress`. The easing is **unmeasured** — no recording in `references/` contains a
 * group transcript — so it uses `ease-in-out`, UIView's default, and says so in `senderAvatarMotion`.
 *
 * @see references/group-avatar.md
