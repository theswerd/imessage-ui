 * iOS 26 measured: SMS green from the simulator. The blue and gray gradients are taken from macOS 26,

 *
 * Not measured, and not in SPEC.md either: `macos.*.sms` (no macOS capture holds a green bubble; the
 * only green in any of them is the plus-menu app icons), `macos.light.edited`, and both `ios.*.separator`
 * values. Treat them as placeholders, not as measurements.
 *
 * `macos.light` is now confirmed against a macOS light capture, not carried over from the dark one.
 * /lab/list?platform=macos&theme=light over 0 90 630 500 of conversation-pane-light.png scores 4.17%
 * with interior mean signed -0.10 (-0.4, -0.0, 0.2) and no tint. Per value, over that region:
 *   - `imessage`: the bubble fill agrees with the capture within 0.5/255 on every clean row of the ramp,
 *     device y 240 to 1140 (mean row error 0.0 to 0.5 in R and G, 0.5 in B), so both endpoints and
 *     `screenHeight: 640` are right. Rows 190-220 are the only misses and they are the capture's tapback.
 *   - `background`: #ffffff exactly, at every probe more than 31pt from the pane's leading edge.
 *   - `incoming`: the link preview fill reads (233,233,235) in the capture and in our render, every row.
 *   - `secondaryLabel`: the "Delivered" label's darkest pixel is (128,128,128) in both.
 * `bubbleMetrics.macos` holds too: `edgeInset` 20.0 on all six bubbles, `maxWidth` 382.5 on both wrapped
 * ones, line pitch 29.97/30.06 device px in the capture against 29.99/30.06 in ours.
 *
 * The 4.17% is entirely outside these files. See the report on that lab row: 30% of it is the ❤️ tapback
 * the fixture omits, the rest is glyph weight from `-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased` in globals.css.
