/**
 * macOS 26 Messages conversation header. Measured from `references/macos/captures/conversation-pane-dark.png`
 * and `conversation-pane-light.png` (pane x 330–960 of a 960×640 window, 2x), in pane coordinates:
 * - compose button: Ø36 glass circle, left 6, top 8. Native's pure-white light rim occupies device columns
 *   13–14 and 84–85 and device rows 16–17 and 86–87, i.e. a box of x 6.5–43 by y 8–44 (36.5 × 36). Chrome
 *   snaps a box's paint origin to a whole CSS px, so left 6.5 renders at 7 and drags the glyph with it;
 *   left 6 keeps "square.and.pencil" ink at its measured 17.5–33.5 on both axes and leaves the rim 0.5
 *   left of native. Stroke ≈1.3, #dcdcdc; the rim (peak #373739 over a #1b1c1c fill) sits inside the circle.
 * - avatar: Ø40 at (295, 8), so its center is (315, 28), the pane's horizontal center.
 * - name pill: a 52.6 × 27.1 stadium centred (315, 57.95), i.e. y 44.4–71.5, whose top 3.6 pt hide under
 *   the avatar. Its caps are **circular**, not a squircle: tracing the rim of the dark capture at 2x and
 *   least-squares fitting a superellipse to 34 outline points gives exponent s = 2.01 (a circle) at
 *   0.45 device px rms, while `corner-shape: superellipse(1.4)` (s = 2.639) only reaches 0.93 rms. The
 *   same fit on our own render returns s = 2.64 exactly, so the fit does separate the two shapes.
 *   Fill #1b1b1b under a 0.75pt rgba(255,255,255,0.13) rim (peak #383838 over the fill); 13pt bold
 *   #f4f4f4 text ("Ben" ink 601–646 px, cap top 53.5, baseline 63) starting 11 from the pill edge, then a
 *   3.55 × 9.5 chevron (#5b5b5b, stroke 2, ink 329–332.6) that spans exactly the cap height.
 * - video button: 40×36 stadium (radius 18: the cap fits a circle to 0.2 pt), right inset 8, top 8. Its
 *   "video" glyph is a 13.75 × 12.3 rounded rect (radius 2, stroke 1.15) at (11.05, 11.65) in button
 *   coordinates plus a triangle whose right edge sits at x 30.1; total ink 592.5–612.65 × 18.9–32.5, #dcdddf.
 * - the bar itself is 55 tall (not visible in a capture: the glass has no edge) and translucent: the list
 *   scrolls under it, blurred and washed toward the pane color (light: #fcfcfc wash, bubbles show at ≈15%;
 *   dark: rgba(30,30,30) wash) for the top 50 pt, fading back to full content by ~95 pt.
 * Light theme (conversation-pane-light.png): buttons and pill are #fcfcfc/#fdfdfd discs with a 1 px white
 * rim and a soft downward shadow (−15/255 just below, −8 above), text #000000, chevron #b1b1b1, glyphs #262626.
 *
 * **How the pill grows.** 52.6 × 27.1 is the box for "Ben"; everything around the name is fixed, so the
 * pill is that name's advance plus a constant **28.25** (11 before the text, 4.7 after it, the 3.55
 * chevron box, 9 after that). Chrome renders "Ben" at 13px/700 `-apple-system` in a 24.766 box, which
 * puts the whole pill at 53.0 against the measured 52.6, and the extra 0.4 is that one string's advance,
 * the same 1.5-on-a-bubble difference `SPEC.md` records for "Second of two". The height never moves. The
 * pill is centred under the avatar on the pane's centre, so a longer name grows it by half each way and
 * the chevron keeps its 9 to the pill's right edge: the checked render of a 22-character group name
 * comes out 179.2 wide, still centred on 315, with the chevron's box still ending 9 inside it.
 * **Unverified**: where it stops growing. Nothing in a capture bounds it, so `maxWidthInset` is
 * judgement: the pill stops 8 short of the video button, whose 48 (right inset 8 plus width 40) is the
 * wider of the two ends, and the name truncates. That keeps the growth symmetric about the centre.
 *
 * **Groups** (`members`). A group's header draws `CKAvatarButton._avatarView` handed every
 * participant, which is `ContactsUICore.SnowglobeUIView`'s stack of circles in the same Ø40 box, and
 * the pill carries the group's name. That stack lives in `group-avatar.tsx`; this file used to carry
 * its own copy of the table and no plate at all. The two copies were identical to 0.000 across all
 * seven rows once both were expressed on the same 44-unit box, so nothing moved when they were
 * merged — what the shared component adds is the `UIBlurEffect` plate behind the faces, which is
 * measured (`groupAvatarPlate`) and which the private copy deliberately did not draw.
 *
 * **Composing** (`compose`). On the Mac a new message is not a sheet and not a screen: the window it
 * is already in becomes the compose window, and this bar becomes the recipient field. The avatar, the
 * name pill and the FaceTime button go; the measured compose button stays where it is; a "To:" field
 * and a ⊕ take the rest of the bar. Nothing about that state is measured — see `macHeaderMetrics.toField`
 * for what came off `CKUIBehaviorMac` and what is a rule — and in particular **none** of it comes from
 * `references/ios/captures/newmsg-light.png`, which is the iPhone's modal sheet and a different surface.
 *
 * The box is `-[CKUIBehaviorMac conversationListContactImageDiameter]` = 40 (Catalyst probe,
 * ChatKit 26.5), which is `macHeaderMetrics.avatar.size` measured off the captures, so the framework
 * and the capture agree and `groupAvatarMetrics.mac.conversationList` is used as the assertion.

   * The "To:" field this bar becomes while a new message is being composed (`compose`).

   * **No capture holds it.** `references/macos/captures` has no frame of a macOS window in compose, and
   * `references/ios/captures/newmsg-light.png` is the iPhone's *sheet* — a different surface on a
   * different platform, so none of its numbers are used here. What is sourced below is sourced from
   * ChatKit 26.5 through a Catalyst probe that swizzles `-[UIDevice userInterfaceIdiom]` to 5 before
   * ChatKit loads and then reads `+[CKUIBehaviorMac sharedBehaviors]`. **`CKUIBehaviorMac` and
   * `CKUIBehaviorPhone` disagree on almost every one of these**, which is the whole reason they were
   * read on the Mac rather than inherited; the Phone reading is quoted beside each so the swap is
   * visible:
   * - `toFieldPreferredHeight` = **44** [Phone 44] — the field's own height.
   * - `toFieldYOffset` = **4** [Phone 0] and `toFieldXOffset` = **4.5** [Phone 0].
   * - `toFieldInternalMarginInsets` = **{0, 12, 0, 14}** [Phone {0, 14, 0, 9}] — what the field keeps
   *   clear inside itself, leading then trailing.
   * - `toFieldInterItemSpacing` = **5** [Phone 0] between the label and the first recipient, and
   *   `toFieldInterlineSpacing` = **6** [Phone 6] between wrapped rows of recipients.
   * - `shouldShowDisclosureChevronInRecipientAtoms` = **0** [Phone **1**]: a recipient token on the Mac
   *   carries no disclosure chevron. `shouldAlignRecipientGlyphsWithMargins` = **1** [Phone 0].
   *
   * `top` is **4**, and that is `toFieldYOffset` and this bar's own measured geometry agreeing rather
   * than a number chosen to fit: the measured compose and video buttons are 36 tall at top 8, so the
   * bar's content is centred on y 26, and a 44 tall field centred on 26 starts at 4 — which is exactly
   * `toFieldYOffset`. `left` is the measured compose button's right edge (6 + 36) plus `toFieldXOffset`.
   *
   * **What is a rule and not a reading.** Where the field *stops* on the right: nothing in the
   * framework or a capture bounds it, so it clears a Ø36 add-recipient button which mirrors the
   * measured compose button's own box to the other end (`addRecipient`). `macNavbarRightMargin` = 20
   * was rejected for that edge, because its partner `macNavbarLeftMargin` = 20 contradicts this bar's
   * *measured* compose button at left 6 — the framework's nav-bar margins are not what macOS 26 draws
   * here, so neither end takes them. The field is drawn flat on the bar's own glass, with no platter
   * and no hairline under it: `recipientSelectionBackgroundPlatterCornerRadius` (10, the same on both
   * idioms) and `recipientSelectionBackgroundPlatterVerticalInset` (4) are recorded here because they
   * were read, but nothing here draws a platter, so they are unused.

                1.55/3.75 path drew), and ink 3.69 × 9.47 spanning the cap height. The same fit reads 1.97
                for the stroke and reads a drawn 2 as 1.96, so 2 stays.
                Two Chrome quirks, both measured back off the render rather than predicted: it snaps an
                inline SVG's paint origin to a whole CSS px vertically, so the box sits on y 53 and the
                viewBox carries the missing half pixel; and horizontally it paints 0.44 CSS px left of the
                box origin `getBoundingClientRect` reports (328.953), so the path coordinates carry that
                back. The ink therefore laps 0.63 past the box's right edge, which `overflow: visible`
                keeps: the box is the layout slot, not the ink box. Re-measure after any change here. */}

            Corner radius 2.3, not 2 and not 2.5: rendering each candidate and comparing the four corner
            quadrants to the capture in coverage space (each image normalised by its own fitted background
            plane, so the content behind the glass cannot bias it) gives rms 0.064 at 2.2, 0.056 at 2.3,
            0.059 at 2.35, 0.087 at 2.5 and 0.125 at 2.65, a parabola with its vertex at 2.30. All four
