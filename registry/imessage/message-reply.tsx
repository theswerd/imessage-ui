/**
 * Inline replies: the quoted stub above a reply, the "N replies" affordance under a message that has
 * a thread, and the focused thread view.
 *
 * PARTLY MEASURED. No native capture of a reply thread exists in `references/`, so the two numbers
 * that describe the stub itself stay provisional: it is drawn at `stubScale` (0.76) of the quoted
 * bubble and at `stubOpacity` (55%). What the stub is built from is measured, and is derived here
 * rather than guessed:
 *
 * - Type, padding, radius, minimum width, tail and maximum width are the platform's measured bubble
 *   metrics multiplied by `stubScale`, so the stub is a real bubble at 76% rather than a picture of
 *   one. It is laid out at that size (no `transform: scale`), which matters for three measured
 *   behaviours: the stub's own edge lands exactly on the reply bubble's measured edge inset, its
 *   screen-space gradient stays in screen coordinates, and `MessageBubble`'s shrink-to-fit still
 *   measures line boxes in unscaled px (under a transform, `getClientRects` returns scaled px and the
 *   bubble sets a frame `scale` too narrow; `message-actions.tsx` documents the same trap).
 * - The gap under the stub is the measured cluster gap (4.33 iOS / 3 macOS), body bottom to body top,
 *   or the measured between-cluster gap (10.33 / 11.5) when the stub carries a tail, that being the
 *   one measured gap a tail is known to hang into. Tails take no layout space, as measured.
 * - A long quote is clamped to `stubMaxLines` with an ellipsis instead of wrapping without limit. Two
 *   lines is what the measured conversation-list preview uses on both platforms and the stub is the
 *   same kind of quotation, but nothing has been measured on the stub itself.
 * - The stub's tail is off by default. The measured rule ("only the last bubble of a cluster has a
 *   tail") would give a lone quoted copy one, but no capture shows the stub, so it stays a prop. When
 *   it is on, the tail is drawn outside the body and nothing on the stub clips it.
 *
 * The reply count reuses the measured secondary label ("Delivered": 11pt / 10pt semibold, its
 * tracking, its gap under the bubble, and #8a8a8e / #808080) rather than a size and colour of its own.
 *
 * NOTHING ABOUT THE THREAD SURFACE IS MEASURED. No capture in `references/` shows a reply thread, and
 * none shows the transition into or out of one, so the count's hit target, the thread's chrome and
 * every timing in `replyThreadMotion` are plausible values rather than readings. They are kept in the
 * family of the two motions that were measured: the long-press overlay (dim 150 ms, entrance 600,
 * dismissal 220) and the "Send with effect" screen (entrance 260, exit 200). The only positions
 * borrowed from a capture are the iOS back control's measured Ø44 box centred (38, 84) and the
 * measured edge insets and cluster gaps the messages inside the thread already use.

/**
 * The stub is **not** a scaled bubble, which is what this file used to assume. ChatKit gives it its
 * own type, its own corner and its own box, and none of them is 0.76 of the bubble's:
 *
 * | value | ChatKit | what `stubScale` 0.76 gave |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | font | `_replyBalloonTextFont` .SFNS-Regular **11.00** | 12.93 |
 * | corner | `textReplyBalloonCornerRadius` **17.5** | 15.21 |
 * | min height | `replyBalloonMinHeight` **26** | 30.4 |
 * | min width | `replyPreviewBalloonMinWidth` **48** | 36.5 |
 * | text inset | `replyBalloonTextContainerInset` **{6.5, 0, 6.5, 0}** | 7.6 / 10.5 |
 * | max lines | `replyBalloonMaximumNumberOfLines` **3** | 2 |
 *
 * The corner is nearly as round as a full bubble's while the type is two thirds the size, so a
 * uniform scale could never have produced it. `stubOpacity` survives: `replyPreviewBalloonImageAlpha`
 * is 0.55, exactly what SPEC already carried.
 *
 * `stubScale` is kept for the parts ChatKit says nothing about - the tail, and the maximum width -
 * so those stay derived from the bubble as before, and it is no longer used for anything ChatKit
 * settles.
 *
 * **macOS is not the same.** `CKUIBehaviorMac` overrides three of them, read at idiom 5 rather than
 * assumed: `textReplyBalloonCornerRadius` **15**, `replyBalloonMinHeight` **20** and
 * `replyBalloonTextContainerInset` **{2, 0, 2, 0}**. It inherits `replyPreviewBalloonMinWidth` 48,
 * `replyBalloonMaximumNumberOfLines` 3 and `replyPreviewBalloonImageAlpha` 0.55. Its reply font was
 * not read, so macOS still derives that one from its own bubble.

 * the same for the long-press overlay and the effects screen.
