/**
 * The "someone is typing" balloon.
 *
 * No capture in `references/` shows a typing indicator - every iOS and macOS still, both 60 fps
 * recordings and every motion contact sheet were checked on 2026-09-08 and none contains one - but
 * ChatKit describes the whole balloon, and the dots that used to be invented here now come from it:
 *
 * | value | ChatKit | what was here |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | dot diameter | `transcriptTypingIndicatorThinkingDotDiameter` **8.5** | 10 |
 * | dot pitch | `transcriptTypingIndicatorThinkingDotSpace` **12.5** centre to centre | 15 (10 + 5) |
 * | balloon | `transcriptTypingIndicatorLargeBubbleSize` **{57.5, 35}** | 3 dots plus the bubble's padding |
 *
 * Read at both idioms: the Mac keeps the same 8.5 dots at the same 12.5 pitch and shrinks only the
 * balloon, to **{44, 27}**.
 * | whole indicator | `transcriptTypingIndicatorDefaultSize` **{78.5, 35}** | - |
 *
 * 12.5 is the pitch and not the gap: three 8.5 dots at that pitch span 33.5, which leaves 12 of
 * padding on each side of the 57.5 balloon. Read as a gap they would span 50.5 and leave 3.5, which
 * no balloon looks like. The balloon's own 35 height replaces the one-line bubble height this used to
 * borrow, and it is 3 pt shorter than the 38 that measured 2 x 10 + 20 gives.
 *
 * ChatKit also has the two smaller bubbles that trail it - `…MediumBubbleSize` {11.5, 11.5} at
 * `…MediumBubbleOffset` (7, -7.5), and the large one at `…LargeBubbleOffset` (14, -28.5) - which is
 * how the 78.5 x 35 whole is bigger than the 57.5 balloon. Those are not drawn here yet.
 *
 * What is still anchored to a capture: the balloon is an incoming bubble, so its corner radius, its
 * traced bottom-left tail and its incoming screen-space fill are read from `bubbleMetrics` and
 * `bubble-shape` and can never drift from a real bubble.
 *
 * Still invented: the 1.2 s pulse and its stagger, and the dot colour, which reuses the platform's
 * measured secondary-label gray because nothing shows the real one.
 * The pulse is a CSS animation with negative delays, so every dot is inside its active phase at every
 * time: pausing `document.getAnimations()` and setting `currentTime` pins the balloon to a frame, and
 * that frozen frame is the one the animation shows while running.
