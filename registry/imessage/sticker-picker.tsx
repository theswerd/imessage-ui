/**
 * The iOS 26 sticker picker: the sheet the plus menu's "Stickers" row opens, its category strip, its
 * grid, and the drag of a sticker out of the sheet and onto a bubble.
 *
 * ## Where the numbers come from
 *
 * **1. A capture of the surface itself.** `references/ios/captures/sticker-picker-light.png`
 * (402x874 @3x, iOS 26.0 simulator, iPhone 17 Pro, light). It is not a screen recording of Messages:
 * the card is drawn out of process by `com.apple.StickerKit.StickerPickerService`, so the capture was
 * made by standing the picker up in a throwaway simulator app —
 * `[[NSClassFromString(@"_UIStickerPickerViewController") alloc] init]`, `setSourceView:` /
 * `setSourceRect:` on a stand-in for the composer's `+`, then `presentCard` — and screenshotting with
 * `xcrun simctl io booted screenshot`. UIKit presents it through `_UIFormSheetPresentationController`,
 * and *that presentation* is what the sheet numbers below measure. The card's own contents (the
 * title, the close button, the category strip, the empty state) are StickerKit's, byte for byte the
 * ones Messages hosts, because they are the same remote view controller.
 *
 * What the capture settles, and what the previous version of this file got wrong:
 *
 * - The picker is **not** the plus menu's own 322.67 x 460.67 glass box. It is a full-width sheet
 *   inset 3.1667 from the screen's left, right and bottom edges, 395.6667 x 456.6667, top at 414.1667,
 *   over a backdrop dimmed by exactly 20% black.
 * - The category strip is at the **top**, under a title row, not pinned to the bottom.
 * - There is a title ("Stickers") and a round close button. There is **no search field** and no
 *   grabber.
 * - The selected category sits on a 43.3333 rounded-square chip, and the strip ends with an `EDIT`
 *   pill rather than another category.
 *
 * | Part | Measured | How |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | sheet inset 3.1667 (l/r/b) | 3.163 / 3.195 / 3.194 | sub-pixel coverage of the one transition pixel on each edge |
 * | sheet top 414.1667 | 414.122 | same, on the centre column |
 * | sheet 395.6667 x 456.6667 | | 402 - 2x3.1667, 874 - 414.1667 - 3.1667 |
 * | top corners R 40.4167 | superellipse n 2.204, rms 0.70 device px | 116 sub-pixel boundary points on the top-left arc |
 * | bottom corners R 60.3333 | same fit, rms 1.00 | 158 points; 62.9 (the iPhone 17 Pro display corner) - 3.1667 = 59.73, so the bottom is concentric with the device |
 * | backdrop dim: black at 0.20 | exact | four known patches behind the sheet: 255→204, 128→102, 0→0, (255,0,0)→(204,0,0) |
 * | sheet glass: white at 0.569 | | the card reads a flat 233 over a backdrop of 204 |
 * | header 63 tall, its row centred at 31.3333 | | the title's ink y 439.0-452.0 and the close button's centre both land on 445.5 |
 * | title ink x 170.0-232.0, centred on 201 | | screen centre; 13.0 of ink height, which is 17pt semibold |
 * | close button Ø 43.3333 centred (361.1667, 445.5) | ±1 | its fill is only 4/255 off the card, fitted from the bottom edge and two chords |
 * | close glyph 16.3333 square | | the X's ink box |
 * | strip 43.3333 tall, first chip's left edge 9.6667 in from the sheet | | chip y 477.1667-520.5, x 12.8333-56.1667 |
 * | chip 43.3333 square, pitch 51.3333 (43.3333 + 8) | | chip centres at x 34.5, 85.83, (137.17), 188.17 |
 * | chip corner R 14.3333 | superellipse n 2.204, rms 0.68 device px | 40 boundary points on the chip's top-left arc |
 * | chip and EDIT pill fill `rgba(118,118,128,0.12)` | exact | over a card of (237,230,230) it predicts (222.8,216.6,217.8); measured (222,217,218). That is `+[UIColor tertiarySystemFillColor]`. |
 * | selected glyph `#000000`, everything else `rgba(60,60,67,0.6)` | | the unselected smiley's core reads (130,128,132) against a predicted (129.2,129.2,133.4). That is `+[UIColor secondaryLabelColor]`. |
 * | category glyph Ø 21.6667, stroke 2.3333 | | the clock and smiley outlines |
 * | pack artwork 23 tall | | both pack icons occupy y 487.333-510.333 exactly |
 * | EDIT pill 45 x 20 | | x 223.5-268.5, y 488.83-508.83 |
 *
 * **2. ChatKit, read natively on iOS rather than through a Catalyst swizzle.** The same throwaway
 * simulator app `dlopen`s `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ChatKit.framework/ChatKit` inside the
 * iOS 26 runtime, where `-[UIDevice userInterfaceIdiom]` really is `.phone` and
 * `+[CKUIBehavior sharedBehaviors]` really vends `CKUIBehaviorPhone` — so nothing here depends on a
 * swizzle holding. Every value below names the selector it came from:
 *
 * | Value | Selector |
 * |---|---|
 * | grid inset 8 on four sides | `attachmentBrowserGridSectionInset` = `{8, 8, 8, 8}` |
 * | grid gaps 4 | `attachmentBrowserGridInterItemSpacing`, `attachmentBrowserGridMinimumLineSpacing` |
 * | grid cell 72.5 x 72.5 | `attachmentBrowserDefaultSizeForSquare` |
 * | cell corner 8 | `stickersCellCornerRadius` |
 * | a landed sticker is 48 x 48 | `stickerReactionSize`, and `emojiStickerTranscriptBalloonSize` for an emoji one |
 * | landed rotation 3 to 10 degrees | `minStickerReactionRotation` / `maxStickerReactionRotation` |
 * | stacked landings overlap 25% across and 35% down, odd rows inset 9.6 | `stickerReactionHorizontalOverlapPercentage`, `stickerReactionVerticalOverlapPercentage`, `stickerReactionOddRowInset` |
 * | the carried sticker shrinks to 5/7 | `-[CKBrowserDragStickerView animateScaleDown]`, read off the layer: a `CASpringAnimation` on `transform.scale.xy`, `fromValue` 1, `toValue` 0.7142857142857143, `duration` 0.91, `speed` 0.8 (so 1137.5 ms of wall clock), `fillMode` forwards |
 * | drag easing cubic-bezier(0.14028, 0.004662, 0.57534, 0.96737) | that animation's `timingFunction`, which `+[CKBrowserDragStickerView springAnimationWithKeyPath:speed:]` installs (damping 400, stiffness 300, mass 2 — overdamped, so `settlingDuration` returns FLT_MAX and the 0.91 duration is the whole of it) |
 * | the carry is elastic, not rigid | the five `CKElasticFunction`s `attachElasticEffectsForLocation:` builds: position x and y tension 550 friction 20, rotation tension 350 friction 15, scale x and y tension 350 friction 20 |
 *
 * A `CKElasticFunction` is a tension/friction spring (`x'' = -T(x - input) - F x'`), so those
 * constants are the whole motion: position lands at omega 23.45 rad/s and zeta 0.426, rotation at
 * 18.71 and 0.401, scale at 18.71 and 0.535. All three are underdamped — the carried sticker lags the
 * finger and overshoots, which is what "elastic" means here, and it is why this file integrates a
 * spring instead of writing the pointer straight into a transform.
 *
 * **The 1.4x lift the previous version drew does not exist.** `-[CKBrowserDragStickerView
 * dragViewScaleUp]` returns 1 whenever the rasterised image is at least as big as the drag view's
 * initial size, which is the ordinary case (measured: `initialSize` {72,72}, `rasterizedImageSize`
 * {72,72}, `dragViewScaleUp` 1, `initialScale` 1). The only scale ChatKit applies is the shrink to
 * 5/7 above. So the sticker lifts at its tile size and gets *smaller*, not bigger.
 *
 * ## What is still not measured
 *
 * - **The grid itself.** Recents was empty in every capture, so no frame of this repo shows a sticker
 *   cell. Switching category needs a tap, the card is out of process, and the simulator on this
 *   machine is shared, so no populated capture exists. The grid below is therefore ChatKit's
 *   *attachment browser* grid — inset 8, gap 4, cell 72.5 — which is the browser the sticker browser
 *   is one of, and it is quoted as such rather than as a measurement of this card. At the measured
 *   sheet width that is five columns of 72.7333. `stickerPickerMetrics.grid` is marked accordingly
 *   and `columns` is a prop.
 * - **Dark.** No dark capture of the card exists. Every dark value is the iOS system pair of a
 *   measured light one, and the glass is `ios-plus-menu.tsx`'s measured dark glass.
 * - **The sheet's own entrance and exit.** Nothing records it. 380 and 220 are the long-press menu's
 *   measured open and exit, the same borrow `photo-picker.tsx` makes.
 * - **The half-second before the shrink.** `animateScaleDown` is measured; the `dispatch_after` that
 *   calls it is not something this probe could reach, so `drag.scaleDelay` is judgement.
 * - **The peel.** `CKBrowserDragStickerView` carries `setUpPeelLayers`, `peelMaskLayer`, `meshLayer`,
 *   `perspectiveLayer` and `shineLayer`, so a real dragged sticker peels off the sheet in 3D with a
 *   mesh warp and a shine. This file draws a flat sticker on the measured springs. That is a known,
 *   deliberate gap, not an oversight.
 * - **The category set.** Recents, Emoji and an `EDIT` pill are in the capture; the two pack icons in
 *   it are the simulator's own installed packs. Which categories a device shows is its own business,
 *   so `tabs` is data, not a constant.
 *
 * ## Motion
 *
 * The sheet is one Web Animations timeline, so `document.getAnimations()` reaches it and `progress`
 * pauses and seeks it to a frame that is a pure function of one scalar. The direction is read off the
 * `open` prop **during render**, never in an effect, so a dismissal always gets committed frames
 * before `onExited` lets the caller unmount it.
 *
 * The live drag is the one thing that reads a clock: it integrates ChatKit's three springs against
 * the pointer, so it is disabled whenever `progress` is scrubbing. `dragPreview` exists for exactly
 * that case — it poses the same lift, carry, shrink and landing as a pure function of a progress
 * scalar, so a harness checkpoint can show a sticker in flight without a pointer.
