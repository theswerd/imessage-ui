/**
 * iOS 26 conversation details screen, measured from `references/ios/captures/details-light.png`
 * and `details-dark.png` (402×874 @3x). Every number below is a point value read off those frames:
 *
 * - Back button Ø44 glass circle centred (38, 84); avatar Ø80 centred (201, 102).
 * - Avatar initials: ink 44.00 wide by 26.67 cap, x 178.67–222.33, y 89.00–115.33. Chrome needs
 *   37.5pt at weight 650 to land there; 34pt semibold is 4.33 too narrow and 2.33 too short.
 * - Name 26pt bold centred on x 201, ink y 152.33–177.67.
 * - Three Ø54 glass action circles centred y 222.67 at x 127 / 201 / 275 (74 pitch). Glyphs are
 *   22pt SF Symbols: available ones use the label colour, unavailable ones tertiary label (30%).
 * - Grouped cells span x 16–386, radius 26 with a continuous corner, 20 between groups: phone
 *   269.67–340.33 (70.67 tall), links 360.33–464.33 (two 52 rows, 1pt separator at 411.33 inset to
 *   x 32–370), Hide Alerts 484.33–536.33, Block Contact 556.33–608.33. Row text starts at x 32.
 * - Cell and button fills are translucent: 6% black in light, 12% white in dark (over pure white
 *   that measures #efeff0, over black #1c1c1f — both read off the captures).
 * - Switch: 63×28 track (radius 14) with a 37×24 knob (radius 12) inset 2, trailing edge at x 372.
 *   Re-measured 2026-09-08 on the Hide Alerts row of both captures: track x 309.00–372.00,
 *   y 496.333–524.333; knob x 311.00–348.00, y 498.333–522.333. Both captures show it **off**; no
 *   capture in this repo holds an on switch, so the on colour comes from the framework instead
 *   (`+[UIColor systemGreenColor]` resolved under each `UIUserInterfaceStyle` in a Mac Catalyst
 *   process with the idiom swizzled to phone: #34c759 light, #30d158 dark). `-[UISwitch
 *   intrinsicContentSize]` there is 61×28, which corroborates the measured 28 track height.
 *   The off track darkens the cell fill by 21% in light and lightens it by 28% in dark (sampled
 *   beside the knob against the bare cell on the same row).
 * - RECENT tag: 41×11.33 pill, radius 3.5, #c7c7cc in both themes, 8.5pt bold label (cap 6).
 *
 * The screen sits over the conversation, which is blurred (σ≈18) and washed out by a 49% white /
 * 59% black scrim; pass that conversation as `backdrop`.
 *
 * ## Under a finger
 *
 * Every pressable thing on this screen has a held state, and none of it is in a capture — a still of
 * a resting screen cannot hold one. Both values come from the framework instead, at the **phone**
 * idiom, and `iosDetailsPress` records which is which: a grouped-list row fills with
 * `-[CKUITheme detailsSelectedCellColor]` (#dcdcdc / #464646) and a round button or a photo tile
 * dims to `-[CKUIBehaviorPhone replyButtonTouchAlpha]` (0.4). The Hide Alerts row is the exception
 * and stays flat, as a `UITableViewCell` carrying a `UISwitch` does. See `usePressed` for why the
 * state is pointer-driven rather than `:active`, and `IosSwitch` for what "the switch does not
 * switch" actually was.
 *
 * The presentation is a separate matter, and its timings are UNMEASURED: no capture in this repo
 * records this screen in motion, so nothing below is a reading off a frame. See `iosDetailsMotion`.
 *
 * ## What the capture does not show
 *
 * `details-light.png` is one scroll position of a conversation with no shared content: the cell
 * stack ends at Block Contact and nothing follows it. Three groups are therefore built from the
 * measured *style* rather than from a frame, and are **UNMEASURED**: the shared photos grid, the
 * shared links list and the shared attachments list (`photos`, `sharedLinks`, `attachments`). They
 * sit between Hide Alerts and Block Contact, which is where they push the destructive row down, and
 * with all three absent the stack reproduces the capture point for point. What they reuse:
 *
 * - The cell geometry, the 20 between groups, the 52 row, the 70.67 two-line cell, the 16 row inset
 *   and the 1pt separator inset to x 32–370 are all measured on this screen.
 * - A two-line item row keeps the measured phone cell's three gaps (16.875 above, 1.5 between,
 *   14.29 below) with its 17pt and 13pt lines swapped, so it is 70.67 tall like the measured one.
 * - The grid is 3 across with a 4 gap, from `+[CKUIBehavior sharedBehaviors]` under the phone
 *   idiom: `attachmentBrowserGridInterItemSpacing` and `attachmentBrowserGridMinimumLineSpacing`
 *   are both 4. Inside the 370 cell at the measured 16 inset that makes a 110 tile. The tile radius
 *   12 is the measured Photos-picker tile radius (SPEC, `photo-picker-light.png`).
 * - The chevron on a row that navigates is the nav bar's measured chevron: 4.67 × 12.67 ink, 2.6
 *   round stroke, #bdbdbd / #5d5d5d (`ios-nav-bar.tsx`).
 *
 * ChatKit 26 actually files shared content under tabs, not under more cells on the info list
 * (`DetailsPhotosTab`, `DetailsLinksTab`, `DetailsAttachmentsTab`, `CKDetailsSegmentedControlCell`).
 * Nothing in `references/` shows that surface, so this file stays with the grouped cells.
 *
 * ## Scrolling
 *
 * Also UNMEASURED, and it cannot be measured from a still. The cells scroll; the header collapses
 * into the conversation's nav bar, which is the exact inverse of the pose the presentation grows
 * out of, so the two ends of the collapse are measured even though the travel between them is not.
 * See `iosDetailsCollapse`. It is seekable: `scroll` (in points) drives paused Web Animations, so
 * `document.getAnimations()` reaches every layer and a checkpoint renders the same twice.

/**
 * The presentation's timings. UNMEASURED, and they cannot be measured from anything in this repo:
 * no capture records this screen in motion. They sit in the family of the ones that were measured:
 *
 * - The rise takes 320 ms on `cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1)`, the curve the measured effects screen
 *   (`ios-effects-picker.tsx`, 260 ms), this file's own Hide Alerts switch (220 ms) and the app
 *   shell's screen transitions (`iosScreenTransition`, 400 ms present) all already use.
 * - The scrim and the shared chrome fade over 220 ms, a little ahead of the rise, the way the
 *   long-press overlay's measured dim (150 of its 600 ms) leads its menu.
 * - The way out is 260 ms on the long-press menu's exit curve, between that menu's own 220 ms exit
 *   and the shell's 280 ms dismiss.
 *
 * What IS measured is the pose at each end. The settled pose is `details-light.png`, unchanged: the
 * timeline is cancelled once it lands, so the screen at rest carries no transform at all. The start
 * pose is the conversation's own nav bar, so the screen grows out of the control that opened it:
 * `ios-nav-bar.tsx` puts the avatar Ø60 centred (201, 92) and the name pill's 17pt text centred on
 * y 133.5 (status bar 54 + pill top 63, 32.33 tall, its span nudged 0.33 down); this screen puts the
 * avatar Ø80 centred (201, 102) and the 28pt name centred on y 162.65. So the avatar grows 60 → 80
 * (scale 0.75) across 10 pt of centre, which is the same thing as growing downward from a top edge
 * both screens put on y 62; the name grows 17 → 28 (scale 0.6071) across 29.15; and the back button
 * does not move at all, being Ø44 at (16, 62) on both. The avatar's 37.5pt initials land on 28.1pt
 * at that scale, a third of a point off the nav bar's own 28.
 *
 * The one number here that touches the capture is `backdropScale`. A sheet pushes what it covers
 * back; under σ18 of blur and a 57% scrim the capture cannot tell whether it did. Diffed against
 * `details-light.png` over 0 60 402 560 the settled screen misses 1713 px of 2,026,080 unscaled and
 * 1642 px at 0.96 (both 0.08%; dark is 3136 / 3068, both 0.15%), so the frame does not decide it and
 * this is a presentation choice, not a measurement. The blur is divided by the scale so that what
 * lands on screen is still σ18.
 *
 * Re-measured 2026-09-09 on the same two frames and the same region: **1639 light, 3624 dark**. The
 * light number is better than the one above and the dark one is worse, and neither move is from the
 * press work in this file — reverting the row clip alone, and then the action circles' paint order
 * alone, each left the dark frame at exactly 3624. Whatever moved it is outside these three files.

 * What a control does under a finger. Two values, both from the framework rather than from a still —

 * - **A grouped-list row fills.** `-[CKUITheme detailsSelectedCellColor]` read at the **phone** idiom
 *   is **#dcdcdc** light and **#464646** dark (`--ios-dt-press`). It is an opaque replacement fill,
 *   not an overlay: the same property is `conversationListSelectedCellColor`, which the list paints
 *   over a white/black ground while details paints it over `detailsBackgroundColor` #ececec / #1e1e1e.
 *   Read as a delta on the details ground that is −16 light and +40 dark, and this screen's own
 *   measured cell composite (#efeff0 over white, #1c1c1f over black) moves −19 and +42 to reach it —
 *   the same step to within three levels, which is the check that the value belongs on this surface
 *   too. **The Mac disagrees and must not be given this value**: at idiom 5 the same selector returns
 *   #ffc726 / #ffc600, a find-highlight yellow.
 * - **A round button, or a photo tile, dims.** `-[CKUIBehaviorPhone replyButtonTouchAlpha]` is
 *   **0.4**, and every idiom including Mac agrees. It is ChatKit's alpha for a round chrome button
 *   held under a finger, so the glass circles and the back button take it directly; applying it to a
 *   shared-photo tile as well is an extension of that reading, not a second one.
 *
 * UNMEASURED, and marked as such where they are used: `pressFade` (how long the fill takes to leave
 * once the finger lifts — instant on the way in, as a `UITableViewCell`'s selected background is) and
 * `pressSlop` (how far the finger may travel before the highlight is given up to a scroll; 10 pt is
 * `UIScrollView`'s own pan threshold).

 * a press state that a finger never opens; and even where it does latch, it survives a scroll that
 * has already carried the row out from under the finger. Pointer events give both: the flag opens on
 * `pointerdown`, is given up the moment the finger travels `pressSlop`, and is cleared by a
 * `pointerup` or `pointercancel` **anywhere** — a listener on the element alone leaves the highlight
 * stuck on when the finger lifts off the edge of it.
 *
 * Nothing here focuses anything. That is deliberate: both engines match `:focus-visible` on a
 * programmatic focus taken while a pointer is still held, so a press state that focused its own row
 * would draw the ring the captures do not have (`tapback-bar.tsx` and `audio-recorder.tsx` document
